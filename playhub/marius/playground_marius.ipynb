I am proud of our \\nstrong teams that have worked to /f_ind even \\nbetter ways to support our customers.  \\n       PAGE 7\\nDuring 2019 the global economy has been \\na/uniFB00ected by increased uncertainties. How \\nis Atlas Copco handling this situation? \\nI believe that our global presence, decentral-\\nized operations and closeness to our custom-\\ners give us the ability to not only adapt to this \\nsomewhat new business climate but to also \\nbene/f_it from it. \\nI believe that our global presence, \\ndecentralized operations and \\ncloseness to our customers give \\nus the ability to not only adapt  \\nto this somewhat new business \\nclimate but to also bene/f_it from it.Atlas Copco has a long history of \\nacquiring companies and in 2019 a record \\nnumber of companies joined the Group. \\nWhat are the criteria when looking at \\npossible acquisitions? \\nOur divisions are responsible for mapping \\nand evaluating businesses that are adjacent \\nto our core businesses and that o/uniFB00er syner-\\ngies. Acquisitions have brought important \\ncontributions in the past and we will con-\\ntinue to complement our organic growth in \\nthis way. To achieve our goal to grow 8 per-\\ncent annually over a business cycle, which is \\nsigni/f_icantly above the global GDP, we need \\nto acquire companies in the right segments. \\nThrough acquisitions we bring in new tech-\\nnologies, service opportunities and people \\nwith new ideas that we can combine with \\nour existing strengths. I am very pleased to \\nwelcome new members into the Group since \\nit brings both opportunities and diversity.  Our business model ensures resilience and \\n/f_lexibility in both good and tougher times. \\nThis past year we have seen increasing \\nunpredictability, a changing business climate \\nand less willingness to invest in some seg-\\nments. We have experienced increased com-\\nplexity due to Brexit and trade wars. Our \\nstrategy and business model have proven \\ne/uniFB00ective despite this and I believe that our \\nresults not only for 2019 but long-term con-\\n/f_irm this.  \\nWe plan and prepare for the future. In \\nareas where there are uncertainties we pre-\\npare for di/uniFB00erent scenarios and how they \\nmight a/uniFB00ect us instead of speculating about \\nwhat the future might bring. We create long-\\nterm growth and value for our customers by \\nkeeping manufacturing and R&D close to \\nthem and with one third of our revenues in \\nEurope, one third in the Americas and one \\nthird in Asia we are a truly global industrial \\ngroup.         PAGE 14Atlas Copco 2019 3PRESIDENT AND CEO\\nWhat about resources devoted to R&D, \\nhas that changed during 2019? \\nWe invest more in R&D than our competitors \\nand during 2019 we accelerated our innova -\\ntion power further. Our aim is to shorten the \\ntime from idea to innovation. We are always \\nlooking to improve our current product \\nrange but we are also looking at projects \\nthat are close to our current products and \\ntechnologies, has signi/f_icant market poten -\\ntial and that accelerate our innovation \\npower. That is why we are now dedicating \\nmore resources to projects that are not more \\nof the same but instead aim to go above and \\nbeyond.\\nFor us innovation is about understanding \\nhow we can bring value to our customers. A \\nproduct can have the coolest features, but if \\nit doesnât make the customerâs products and \\nprocesses cheaper, safer, more precise or less \\nenergy consuming, then it is just another \\nproduct â not an innovation. \\n       PAGE 35\\nWhat value does digitalization bring? \\nDigitalization brings value to our customers \\nin almost every aspect of their operations. \\nMost evidently, our products are essential \\nwhen it comes to enabling the storing and \\nprocessing of data, and needed to produce \\nsensors, /f_lat screens and other equipment \\nthat are part of our everyday life. \\nBut digitalization brings value on deeper \\nlevels as well. Our connected products col -\\nlect customersâ data and we add value \\nthrough our experience, analytic abilities \\nand improved service o/uniFB00ering. Digitized pro -\\nduction lines will enable us to measure and \\nmonitor our customersâ equipment, and to \\nplan and foresee maintenance by seeing \\nwhich parts actually need to be replaced and \\nwhen. This is of high importance to our cus -\\ntomers as our products are key to their pro -\\nduction process and failures often come at a \\nhigh cost. Digitalization makes it possible to sell increased productivity and uptime as a \\nproduct instead of /f_irst selling a product and \\nthen adding an optional service program. \\nThis way we can go towards predictive or \\nprescriptive service programs based on the \\ndata collected, instead of /f_ixing something \\nalready broken. The bene/f_its for the cus -\\ntomer are many, not least maximum uptime \\nand optimal productivity, and we saw \\ngrowth in service in all business areas during \\n2019. \\nDigitalization also brings value if we can \\nleverage it to create a better customer expe -\\nrience by making it easier to access informa -\\ntion about our products as well as buying \\nthem and tracking deliveries online. \\nWith increased focus on sustainability  \\nand climate change, what role can  \\nAtlas Copco play?\\nFor decades, Atlas Copco has made import -\\nant technological advances to improve  \\nour productsâ energy e/uniFB03ciency, thereby For us innovation is about understanding how we can  bring value to our  \\ncustomers.

This is our core  \\ncompetence and mandate. It remains the \\nmost impactful way we can reduce carbon \\nemissions and contribute to our customersâ \\nand our own sustainability ambitions. One \\nprominent example is the VSD+ technology \\nused in compressors, generators and vacuum \\npumps, which o/uniFB00ers our customers notable \\nenergy savings. Another example is Atlas \\nCopco abatement systems that remove \\ngreenhouse gases in the semiconductor \\nindustry. \\nIt is said by many that 2020 is the start of \\nthe âdecade for actionâ for achieving the  \\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set \\nby the United Nations, and I agree.

When I meet with colleagues all over \\nthe world I am impressed by how our com -\\npany culture and teams in many ways tran -\\nscend borders. We allow mobility and \\nencourage development and willingness  \\nto change. Diversity is key to attract and keep talent as \\nwell as to boost innovation. We also ensure \\nthat our employees understand the aspects \\nof ethics most relevant to their roles, and \\nhelp prepare them to avoid or to handle  \\nethically challenging situations. \\nWhen it comes to reducing carbon diox -\\nide, we take increased responsibility for the \\nenvironmental impact of our products by \\nstrengthening our focus on the footprint \\nthroughout their entire life-cycle. In every -\\nthing we do we strive to contribute to a bet -\\nter future and bring value to our customers, \\nemployees and shareholders.        PAGE 42\\nWhat are the results this far? \\nThe goal for reducing carbon dioxide from \\noperations and transport has already had \\nconsiderable impact in the organization \\nsince its launch in early 2019. We have seen \\nsigni/f_icant investment and action across the \\norganization to increase the share of renew -\\nable electricity and solar energy, improved \\nforecasting to reduce air freight, and product \\ntesting using biodiesel. These measures have \\nreduced carbon dioxide emissions from our \\nown operations and transport of goods.

Innovation and \\nproduct development are very important \\nand products are designed internally. \\nA key activity is to design new or improved \\nproducts that provide sustainable and  \\ntangible bene/f_its in terms of productivity, \\nenergy e/uniFB03ciency and/or lower life-cycle cost \\nfor the customer, and at the same time can \\nbe e/uniFB03ciently produced.

Innovation will improve \\ncustomer satisfaction and contribute to \\nstrengthening customer relations, the  \\nbrand, as well as /f_inancial performance. \\nOvercapacities and ine/uniFB03ciencies must \\nalways be challenged. \\nInvestments in /f_ixed assets and \\nworking capital\\nThe need for investments in property, plant \\nand equipment are moderate due to the \\nmanufacturing philosophy and can be \\nadapted in the short and medium term to \\nchanges in demand. Most investments are \\nrelated to machining equipment for core \\nmanufacturing activities and to production \\nfacilities, primarily for core component  \\nmanufacturing and assembly operations. \\nThe working capital requirements of the \\nGroup are a/uniFB00ected by the relative high share \\nof sales through own customer centers, \\nwhich a/uniFB00ects the amount of inventory and receivables. In an improving business climate \\nwith higher volumes, more working capital \\nwill be tied up. If the business climate deteri -\\norates, working capital will be released.\\nAcquisitions\\nAcquisitions are primarily made in, or very \\nclose to, already existing core businesses.

The organic growth was 3%, m ore favorable \\nexchange rates contributed with 5%, and acquisition s added 1%. \\nThe service business, including specialty rental, c ontinued to grow, \\nwith increased order volumes in all business areas.  In total, the order \\nintake for service increased about 6% organically, while orders for \\nequipment increased by approximately 1% organically .\\nOrder volumes increased for compressors, mainly sup ported by \\nincreased demand for large industrial, and gas and process compressors, \\nparticularly in Asia. Orders for small and medium-s ized industrial  \\ncompressors were essentially unchanged.\\nThe demand for vacuum equipment to the semiconducto r industry \\nremained at about the same high level as in the pre vious year, sup-\\nported primarily by increased demand in China, and investments in \\nnew production technologies in other regions. Order  volumes for vacuum \\nequipment to the industrial and scienti/f_ic markets w ere negatively \\na/uniFB00ected by weakened demand in Asia and Europe.\\nThe order intake for advanced industrial tools and assembly solu -\\ntions decreased, mainly due to weakened demand from  the motor \\nvehicle industry in the latter half of the year, pa rticularly in Asia and \\nNorth America. \\nOrder volumes increased for portable air and power and /f_low prod -\\nucts, such as portable compressors, construction to ols, generators and \\npumps, supported by demand from equipment rental co mpanies in \\nthe /f_irst half of the year. More information can be found in the business \\narea sections on pages 20â33.\\nNorth America\\nOrders received in North America increased 5% in lo cal currencies. \\nOrder volumes increased for larger compressors, ind ustrial vacuum \\npumps, and vacuum equipment to the semiconductor in dustry, as well \\nas for power equipment. However, the order intake f or industrial tools \\nand assembly solutions decreased, due to weakened d emand from the \\nmotor vehicle industry. The service business increa sed in all business \\nareas except Industrial Technique. North America ac counted for 25% \\n(24) of orders received.\\nSouth America\\nOrders received in South America increased 12% in l ocal currencies. \\nThe growth was supported by improved demand for com pressors and \\npower equipment, while the demand for industrial to ols and assembly \\nsolutions decreased. Solid growth was achieved for the service business. \\nIn total, South America accounted for 4% (4) of ord ers received.\\n Europe\\nOrders received in Europe increased 3% in local cur rencies. Order  \\nvolumes for equipment remained at about the same le vel as the previ -\\nous year. The order intake increased for most types  of compressors \\nand power equipment, but decreased for vacuum equip ment, and \\nindustrial tools and assembly solutions. Order volu mes for the service \\nbusiness increased in all business areas. In total,  Europe accounted for \\n30% (31) of orders received.  \\nAfrica/Middle East\\nOrders received increased 4% in Africa/Middle East in local currencies. \\nThe order intake for larger industrial compressors as well as gas and \\nprocess compressors increased, while volumes for po rtable compressors \\ndeclined. The order intake for industrial tools and  assembly solutions \\nalso increased, as well as for service, supported b y strong demand for \\nspecialty rental solutions. In total, Africa/Middle  East accounted for \\n6% (6) of orders received.\\nAsia/Oceania\\nOrder intake in local currencies in Asia/Oceania in creased by 4%. Order \\nvolumes increased for equipment, and solid growth w as achieved for \\nservice. The order intake for compressors increased , primarily supported \\nby the demand for portable and larger stationary co mpressors. Order \\nvolumes for vacuum equipment grew, driven by increa sed demand from \\nthe semiconductor and /f_lat-panel display industries,  particularly in \\nChina. The order intake for industrial tools and as sembly solutions \\ndecreased markedly, mainly explained by weakened de mand from the \\nmotor vehicle industry in China. In total, Asia/Oce ania accounted for \\n35% (35) of orders received.  \\nMarket presence\\nThe market presence was further strengthened with t he addition  \\nof sales and service engineers in several markets. \\nAtlas Copco had own customer centers in 71 (71) cou ntries and  \\nproduction facilities in 19 (19) countries.

Such risks are mainly assessed and \\naddressed within the risk-management sys -\\ntem at divisional level, see page 46. Among \\nthe risks are also increased energy prices and \\ntaxes, and regulations related to CO2 emis -\\nsions. Atlas Copcoâs continuous work to \\nincrease the energy e/uniFB03ciency of its products \\nhelps mitigate such risks and represents a \\npotential market opportunity. \\nChanging weather patterns may pose a \\nphysical risk to operational units or suppliers \\nin areas in risk of raising sea levels, water scar -\\ncity or violent storms. Market shifts toward a \\nlow-carbon economy may impact the viabil -\\nity of certain sectors and give rise to new \\nbusinesses and business models to be served \\nby Atlas Copco. For instance, increased gen -\\neration of renewable energy, such as solar \\npanels and wind mills, and the surge in pro -\\nduction of electrical vehicles present business \\nopportunities to provide products and ser -\\nvices to these industries.\\nIncreased use of renewable energy\\nThe ambition to reduce negative climate \\nimpact spurs the increased use of renewable \\nenergy in the Groupâs operations. Diversify -\\ning sources of energy to include renewable \\nenergy has a positive environmental impact \\nand protects the business from price /f_luctua -\\ntions and the lack of traditional energy \\nsources. \\nIn some markets, renewable energy  \\nmay not be readily available or is a minor \\ncomponent in the countryâs energy mix.  This composes a challenge to Atlas Copcoâs \\nability to meet its target to reduce CO2 emis -\\nsions from energy in operations. The energy \\nmix supplied also in/f_luences the impact from \\nthe use-phase of products, and thereby Atlas \\nCopcoâs value-chain footprint. E/uniFB00orts are \\nmade to increase the percentage of renew -\\nable energy used in operations. In 2019, the \\npercentage of renewable energy of total \\nenergy used in operations increased to 41% \\n(34). \\nImpact from operations and \\ntransportation of goods\\nAtlas Copcoâs ambition is to reduce the CO2 \\nemissions from energy in operations and \\ntransport of goods by half in relation to cost \\nof sales by 2030. To achieve this, a wide range \\nof actions is undertaken. Buying renewable \\nelectricity from the grid, installing solar pan -\\nels, switching to bio-fuels in tests of compres -\\nsors, and implementing energy-conservation \\nmeasures are some examples. Regarding CO2 \\nfrom transportation of goods, collaboration \\nwith freight forwarders and a restrictive use \\nof airfreight are examples of actions under -\\ntaken and planned. However, the nature of \\nthe business makes avoiding airfreight com -\\nplicated. Collaboration with transport part -\\nners, and to some extent technical develop -\\nments, are key enablers to achieve Atlas  \\nCopcoâs ambitious goal in this area. \\nIn 2019, Atlas Copco decreased the CO2 \\nemissions from energy in operations and \\ntransport of goods in relation to cost of sales \\nby 19%.

Well-manage d risks can lead to opportunities and add \\nvalue to the business while risks that are not well -managed can lead to incidents and losses.  \\nAtlas Copcoâs global and diversi/f_ied business towards many customer \\nsegments results in a variety of risks and opportunities geographically \\nand operationally. Thus, the ability to identify, analyze and manage \\nrisks is crucial for e/uniFB00ective governance and control of the business. \\nThe aim is to achieve Group goals with a high risk awareness and well-\\nmanaged risk taking, in line with the strategy and within the frame of \\nthe companyâs manual âThe Way We Do Thingsâ. Atlas Copco sees the \\nbene/f_its of an e/uniFB03cient risk management both from risk reduction and \\nbusiness opportunity perspectives, which can lead to good business \\ngrowth.\\nThe Groupâs risk management approach follows the decentralized \\nstructure of Atlas Copco. Local companies are responsible for their own \\nrisk management, which is monitored and followed up regularly e.g. at \\nlocal business board meetings. Group functions for legal, insurance, \\nsustainability, treasury, tax, controlling and accounting provide policies, \\nguidelines and instructions regarding risk management. This is regu-\\nlarly audited by internal and external audits. Examples of risks and how \\nthey are handled in Atlas Copco are shown in the table in this section.\\nInsurance\\nThe Group Insurance Program is provided by the in-house insurance \\ncompany Industria Insurance Company Ltd. which retains part of the \\nrisk exposure for the following insurance lines; property damage, \\nbusiness interruption, transport, and general and product liability. \\nFinancial lines insurance and business travel insurance are managed \\nby the Groupâs Insurance and Risk Management department. How-\\never, Industria is not the insurer for these two lines. Insurance capacity \\nis purchased from leading insurers and reinsurers by way of using \\ninternational insurance brokers. Claims management services are \\npartly purchased on a global basis from leading providers. Insurance \\npolicies are issued on a local basis to ensure compliance with local \\ninsurance laws where required.  \\nLoss prevention\\nThe main purpose of Atlas Copcoâs loss prevention process is to  \\nprevent potential property losses and business interruptions. Atlas \\nCopcoâs Loss Prevention Standard stipulates Group requirements in \\nregards of loss prevention for product companies and distribution \\ncenters, including areas like: construction, safety systems, loss preven-\\ntion procedures and plans that need to be prepared. To ensure align-\\nment with the standard and to support sitesâ understanding of how \\nthe standard applies to each site, around 25 risk surveys are per-\\nformed annually. The results from the risk surveys are consolidated \\nand reported to Group Management.ATLAS COPCO\\nEnterprise Risk \\nManagement \\nprocessMonitor and \\nre-evaluateRisk  \\nidenti/f_ication\\nRisk  \\nmanagementRisk \\nevaluationRisk \\nanalysis\\nRisk process\\nIn Atlas Copco, Enterprise Risk Management is not seen as a project but  \\nas a continuous process. The risk environment changes over time and it is \\ntherefore necessary to continuously revisit, update and identify new \\nrisks. The de/f_ined framework is described in the picture above.Enterprise risk management\\nAtlas Copco has developed an enterprise risk management process to \\nmap strategic risks. The methodology used is applied on divisions, \\nwhich is the highest operational level in the Group. Annual work-\\nshops are held by each divisional management team where risks are \\nidenti/f_ied, analyzed, evaluated/re-evaluated and managed to ensure \\na structured and proactive approach to risks exposing Atlas Copco. \\nThe ownership of managing the risks raised in this process lies within \\neach division, while the Insurance and Risk Management department \\nmanages the overall process, moderates the sessions and consoli-\\ndates the results on Group level. This hands-on approach is also in line \\nwith Atlas Copcoâs decentralized structure. The results are reported to \\nGroup Management annually and to each Business Area President \\nsemi-annually.Atlas Copco 2019 45THE YEAR IN REVIEW â RISKS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND OPPORTUNITIES\\nLEGAL Atlas Copcoâs business operations are \\na/uniFB00ected by numerous laws, regulations \\nand trade sanctions as well as commercial \\nand /f_inancial agreements with customers, \\nsuppliers and other counterparties, and \\nalso by licenses, patents and other intangi -\\nble property rights. â¢  Inhouse lawyers on /f_ive continents support Group \\ncompanies with advice on laws and regulations inclu d-\\ning compliance as well as support with contract \\nreviews.

Experience from \\nmanufacturing industry with international \\ncoverage is important, as it is Atlas Copcoâs \\nmain focus. The Nomination Committeeâs \\ndiversity policy is based on section 4.1 in the \\nCorporate Governance Code. The nine Board \\nmembers elected by the shareholders have \\nbackgrounds from various industries. Three \\nof the eight non-executive members are \\nwomen. Three are born in the 1960âs, three in \\nthe 1950âs, two in the 1940âs, and one person \\nis born in the 1970âs. The Board members are \\nof three di /uniFB00erent nationalities from Germany \\nand the United States, with a majority of the \\nBoard members coming from Sweden. \\nIncreasing the diversity of the Board of Direc-\\ntors with regards to gender is a priority for \\nthe Nomination Committee.Based on the /f_indings of the Chair of the \\nBoard, the Nomination Committee annually \\nevaluates the work of the Board. Further to \\nthat, the Nomination Committee proposes \\nthe Chair to the Annual General Meeting, \\nprepares a proposal regarding number and \\nnames of Board members, including Chair \\nand a proposal for remuneration to the Chair \\nand other Board members not employed by \\nthe Company, as well as a proposal for remu-\\nneration for Board committee work.

Further, the Board regu-\\nlarly ensures that e/uniFB03cient control systems \\nare in place. The Board also follows up on the \\ncompliance of the Business Code of Practice as well as the whistleblowing system. Besides \\nthe general distribution of responsibilities \\nthat apply, in accordance with the Swedish \\nCompanies Act and the Code, the Board and \\nits committees (Audit Committee, Remuner-\\nation Committee and others) annually \\nreview and adopt âThe Rules of Procedureâ \\nand âThe Written Instructionsâ, which are \\ndocuments that govern the Boardâs work and \\ndistribution of tasks between the Board, the \\ncommittees and the President as well as the \\nCompanyâs reporting processes.\\nThe Board held eight meetings in 2019. Five \\nmeetings were held at Atlas Copco AB in \\nNacka, Sweden, one per capsulam, one per \\ntelephone and one meeting in Antwerp dur-\\ning the study trip in the fall. The attendance at \\nBoard meetings is presented on page 56â57.\\nThe Board continuously evaluates the  \\nperformance of the President and CEO, Mats \\nRahmstrÃ¶m. For the Annual Audit, the com-\\npanyâs principal auditor, Thomas StrÃ¶mberg, \\nDeloitte, reported his observations and the \\nBoard also had a separate session with the \\nauditor where members of Group Manage-\\nment were not present. \\nEvaluation of the Board of Directorsâ work \\nThe annual evaluation of the Board of  \\nDirectorsâ work, including the Boardâs com-\\nmittees (Audit Committee, Remuneration \\nCommittee and others) was conducted by \\nthe Chair of the Board, Hans StrÃ¥berg.

Audit Committee\\nThe Audit Committee is selected by the \\nBoard at the statutory Board meeting after \\nthe Annual General Meeting and until the \\nstatutory Board meeting the following year. \\nThe work of the Audit Committee is directed \\nby the Audit Committee Charter, which is \\nreviewed and approved annually by the \\nBoard. The Chair of the committee has the \\naccounting competence required by the \\nSwedish Companies Act and two of the \\nmembers are independent from the Com-\\npany and its main shareholder. The Audit \\nCommitteeâs primary task is to support the \\nBoard of Directors in ful/f_illing its responsibili-\\nties in the areas of audit and internal control, \\naccounting, /f_inancial reporting and risk man-\\nagement as well as to supervise the /f_inancial \\nstructure and operations of the Group and \\napprove /f_inancial guarantees and new legal \\nentities, delegated by the Board. The Audit \\nCommittee work further includes reviewing \\ninternal audit procedures, monitoring the \\nexternal auditor, considering any inspection \\n/f_indings, review and monitor the indepen-\\ndence of the external auditor, and assist the \\nNomination Committee in the selection of \\nthe auditor.\\nDuring the year, the committee convened \\n/f_ive times. All members were present at these \\nmeetings. All meetings of the Audit Commit-\\ntee have been reported to the Board of Direc-\\ntors and the corresponding Minutes have \\nbeen distributed to the Board.  \\nThe Audit Committee during 2019 was  \\nSta/uniFB00an Bohman, Chair, Gunilla Berg, Johan \\nForssell and Hans StrÃ¥berg.\\nAtlas Copco is registered in Sweden and is legally governed by the \\nSwedish Companies Act (2005:551). This act requires that the \\nBoard of Directors governs the Company to be pro/f_itable and cre-\\nate value for its shareholders. However, Atlas Copco recognizes \\ngoing beyond this, extending it to integrating sustainability into \\nits business creates long-term value for all stakeholders, which is \\nultimately in the best interest of the Company, the shareholders \\nand society. The signi/f_icant stakeholder audience, as outlined in \\nthe Atlas Copco Business Code of Practice, includes representa-\\ntives of society, em ployees, customers, business partners and \\nshareholders.\\nThe Business Code of Practice is the central guiding policy for \\nAtlas Copco, and is owned by the Board of Directors. Its commit-\\nment goes beyond the requirements of legal compliance, to sup-\\nport voluntary international ethical guidelines. These include the \\nUnited Nations International Bill of Human Rights, International \\nLabour Organizationâs Declaration on Fundamental Principles \\nand Rights at Work, the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and OECDâs Guidelines for Multinational Enter-\\nprises. Atlas Copco has employed a stakeholder-driven approach \\nin order to identify the most material environmental, human \\nrights, labor and ethical aspects of its business. These priorities \\nguide how the Group develops and drives its business strategy, as \\nwell as its roadmap to support the UN Sustainable Development \\nGoals. \\nThe strategic pillars together with the Group goals presen ted \\non pages 5 and 11 all aim at continuously delivering sustainable, \\npro/f_itable growth for the Group. This means an increased eco-\\nnomic value creation and, simultaneously, a positive impact on \\nsociety and the environment, thus creating shared value. \\nAtlas Copco monitors and voluntarily discloses the progress on \\nthese material /f_inancial and non-/f_inancial aspects, through an \\nexternally assured, integrated annual report. In addition to the \\nAnnual General Meeting, Atlas Copco also creates engagement \\nopportunities so that non-shareholders can address the Group in \\nvarious stakeholder dialogues.Statement of materiality and signi/f_icant audiences 6. Remuneration Committee\\nThe Remuneration Committeeâs primary task \\nis to propose to the Board the remuneration \\nto the President and CEO and a long-term \\nincentive plan for key employees. The goal \\nwith a long-term incentive plan is to align the \\ninterests of key personnel with those of the \\nshareholders. The Remuneration Policy for \\nGroup Management aims to establish princi-\\nples for a fair and consistent remuneration \\nwith respect to compensation, bene/f_its, and \\ntermination.

The President \\nand CEO is responsible for the ongoing man-\\nagement of the Group following the Boardâs \\nguidelines and instructions. \\nRemuneration to Group Management \\nThe Remuneration Policy is reviewed and \\npresented to the AGM by the Board of Direc-\\ntors for approval every year. In 2019, the AGM \\ndecided to adopt the Boardâs proposal. The remuneration covers an annual base  \\nsalary, variable compensation, possible long-\\nterm incentive (personnel options), pension \\npremium and other bene/f_its. The variable \\ncompensation is limited to a maximum per-\\ncentage of the base salary. Variable compen-\\nsation is dependent upon how certain quan-\\ntitative and qualitative goals set in advance \\nare achieved. These goals are based on /f_inan-\\ncial and non-/f_inancial parameters and vary \\nbetween di/uniFB00erent positions. Non-/f_inancial \\nparameters have for example been in rela-\\ntion to the Business Code of Practice.

PRINCIPLES\\nThe consolidated /f_inancial statements comprise Atlas  Copco AB, the Parent \\nCompany (âthe Companyâ), and its subsidiaries (toge ther âthe Groupâ or Atlas \\nCopco) and the Groupâs interest in associated compa nies and joint ventures. \\nAtlas Copco AB is headquartered in Nacka, Sweden.\\nBasis of preparation\\nThe consolidated /f_inancial statements have been prep ared in accordance with \\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the EU. The \\nstatements are also prepared in accordance with the  Swedish recommendation \\nRFR 1 âSupplementary Accounting Rules for Groupsâ a nd applicable statements \\nissued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. Th ese require certain addi -\\ntional disclosures for Swedish consolidated /f_inancia l statements prepared in \\naccordance with IFRS.\\nThe accounting principles set out below have been c onsistently applied to all \\nperiods presented, unless otherwise stated, and for  all entities included in the \\nconsolidated /f_inancial statements. The annual report  for the Group and for Atlas \\nCopco AB, including /f_inancial statements, was approv ed for issuance on Febru -\\nary 28, 2020. The balance sheets and income stateme nts are subject to approval \\nby the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders o n April 23, 2020.\\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe consolidated /f_inancial statements have been prep ared in accordance with \\nthe acquisition method. Accordingly, business combi nations are seen as if the \\nGroup directly acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities of the entity \\nacquired. The consolidated income statements and ba lance sheets of the Group \\ninclude all entities in which the Company, directly  or indirectly, has control. \\nControl exists when the Company has power over the entity, is exposed, or \\nhas rights, to variable returns from its involvemen t with the entity and has the \\nability to use its power to a/uniFB00ect its returns. Gene rally, control and hence consoli -\\ndation is based on ownership. In a few exceptions, consolidation is based on \\nagreements that give the Group control over an enti ty. See note A22 for infor -\\nmation on the Groupâs subsidiaries.  \\nIntra-group balances and internal income and expens e arising from intra-\\ngroup transactions are fully eliminated in preparin g the consolidated /f_inancial \\nstatements. Gains and losses arising from intra-gro up transactions that are rec -\\nognized in assets, such as inventory and /f_ixed asset s, are eliminated in full, but \\nlosses only to the extent that there is no evidence  of impairment.\\nBusiness combinations\\nAt the acquisition date, i.e. the date on which con trol is obtained, each identi/f_i -\\nable asset acquired and liability assumed is recogn ized at its acquisition-date \\nfair value. The consideration transferred, measured at fair value, in cludes assets \\ntransferred by the Group, liabilities to the former  owners of the acquiree and the \\nequity interests issued by the Group in exchange fo r control of the acquiree. Any \\nsubsequent change in such fair value is recognized in pro/f_it or loss, unless the \\ncontingent consideration is classi/f_ied as equity. Transactions costs  that the \\nGroup incur in connection with a business combinati on are expensed as \\nincurred.\\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of th e consideration trans -\\nferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests  in the acquiree, and the fair \\nvalue of the Groupâs previously held equity interes t in the acquiree (if any) over \\nthe net of acquisition-date fair value amounts of t he identi/f_iable assets acquired \\nand liabilities assumed. \\nNon-controlling interest is initially measured eith er \\nâ¢ at fair value, or \\nâ¢ at the non-controlling interestâs proportionate s hare of the fair value of  \\nidenti/f_iable net assets. \\nSubsequent pro/f_it or loss attributable to the non-co ntrolling interest is allo -\\ncated to the non-controlling interest, even if it p uts the non-controlling interest \\nin a de/f_icit position. Acquisitions of non-controlli ng interests are recognized as a \\ntransaction between equity attributable to owners o f the parent and non-con -\\ntrolling interests. The di/uniFB00erence between considera tion paid and the propor -\\ntionate share of net assets acquired is recognized in equity. For details on the \\nacquisitions made during the year, see note 2.\\nAssociated companies and joint ventures\\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has si gni/f_icant in/f_luence, but not \\ncontrol, over /f_inancial and operating policies. When  the Group holds 20â50% of \\nthe voting power, it is presumed that signi/f_icant in /f_luence exists, unless other -\\nwise demonstrated. A joint venture is an entity ove r which the Group has joint \\ncontrol, through contractual agreements with one or  more parties. Investments \\nin associated companies and joint ventures are repo rted according to the equity \\nmethod. This means that the carrying value of inter ests in an associate or joint \\nventure corresponds to the Groupâs share of reporte d equity of the associate or 1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements\\njoint venture, plus any goodwill, and any other rem aining fair value adjustments \\nrecognized at acquisition date. \\nâShares of pro/f_it in associated companies and joint venturesâ, included in the \\nincome statements, comprises the Groupâs share of t he associateâs and joint \\nventureâs income after tax adjusted for any amortiz ation and depreciation, \\nimpairment losses, and other adjustments arising fr om any remaining fair value \\nadjustments recognized at acquisition date. Dividen ds received from an associ -\\nated company or joint venture reduce the carrying v alue of the investment.\\nUnrealized gains and losses arising from transactio ns with an associate or a \\njoint venture are eliminated to the extent of the G roupâs interest, but losses only \\nto the extent that there is no evidence of impairme nt of the asset. When the \\nGroupâs share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its \\ninterest in the associate or joint venture, the Gro up does not recognize further \\nlosses unless the Group has incurred obligations or  made payments on behalf of \\nthe associate.\\nFunctional currency and foreign currency translatio n \\nThe consolidated /f_inancial statements are presented in Swedish krona (SEK), \\nwhich is the functional currency for Atlas Copco AB  and also the presentation \\ncurrency for the Groupâs /f_inancial reporting. Unless  otherwise stated, the \\namounts presented are in millions Swedish krona (MS EK).\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated a t the foreign exchange rate \\nruling at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary  items carried at historical \\ncost are reported using the exchange rate at the da te of the transaction and \\nnon-monetary items carried at fair value are report ed at the rate that existed \\nwhen the fair values were determined. Tangible and intangible assets, inventory \\nand advanced payments are examples of non-monetary items. \\nReceivables and liabilities and other monetary item s denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies are translated using the foreign exchang e rate at the balance sheet \\ndate. The exchange gains and losses related to rece ivables and payables and \\nother operating receivables and liabilities are inc luded in âOther operating \\nincome and expensesâ and foreign exchange gains and  losses attributable to \\nother /f_inancial assets and liabilities are included in âFinancial income and \\nexpensesâ. Exchange rate di/uniFB00erences on translation to functional currency are \\nreported in other comprehensive income in the follo wing cases: \\nâ¢ translation of a /f_inancial liability designated as  a hedge of the net investment \\nin a foreign operation,\\nâ¢ translation of intra-group receivables from, or l iabilities to, a foreign opera -\\ntion that in substance is part of the net investmen t in the foreign operation,\\nâ¢ cash /f_low hedges of foreign currency to the extent  that the hedge is e/uniFB00ective. \\nIn the consolidation, the balance sheets of foreign  subsidiaries are translated to \\nSEK using exchange rates at the end of the reportin g period and the income \\nstatements are translated at the average rates for the reporting period. Foreign \\nexchange di/uniFB00erences arising on such translation are  recognized in other com -\\nprehensive income and are accumulated in the curren cy translation reserve in \\nequity. Exchange rates for major currencies that ha ve been used for the consoli -\\ndated /f_inancial statements are shown in note 27.\\nSegment reporting\\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group th at engages in business \\nactivities from which it may earn revenue and incur  expenses, and for which dis -\\ncrete /f_inancial information is available. The operat ing results of all operating \\nsegments are reviewed regularly by the Groupâs Pres ident and CEO, the chief \\noperating decision maker, to make decisions about a llocation of resources to \\nthe segments and also to assess their performance. See note 4 for additional \\ninformation.\\nRevenue recognition\\nRevenue is recognized at an amount that re/f_lects the  expected and entitled  \\nconsideration for transferring goods and/or service s to customers when control \\nhas passed to the customer.\\nGoods sold\\nRevenue from goods sold are recognized at one point  in time when control of \\nthe good has been transferred to the customer. This  occurs for example when \\nthe Group has a present right to payment for the go od, the customer has legal \\ntitle of the good, the good has been delivered to t he customer and/or the cus -\\ntomer has the signi/f_icant risks and rewards of the o wnership of the good.\\nWhen the goods sold are highly customized and an en forceable right to pay -\\nment is present, revenue is recognized over time us ing the proportion of cost \\nincurred to date compared to estimated total cost t o measure the progress \\ntowards complete satisfaction of that performance o bligation and thereby \\ntransferring the control of the good to the custome r. \\nFor buy-back commitments where the buy-back price i s lower than the origi -\\nnal selling price but there is an economic incentiv e for the customer to use the \\nbuy-back commitment option, the transaction is acco unted for as a lease. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\n68 Atlas Copco 2019Variable consideration\\nSome contracts with customers provide a right of re turn, trade discounts or vol -\\nume rebates. If revenue cannot be reliably measured , the Group defers revenue \\nuntil the uncertainty is resolved. Such liabilities  are estimated at contract incep -\\ntion and updated thereafter. \\nRights of return\\nWhen a contract with a customer provides a right to  return the good within a \\nspeci/f_ied period, the Group accounts for the right o f return using the expected \\nvalue method. The amount of revenue related to the expected returns is deferred \\nand recognized in the statement of /f_inancial positio n within âOther liabilitiesâ.  \\nA corresponding adjustment is made to the cost of s ales and recognized in the \\nstatement of /f_inancial position within âInventoriesâ .\\nRendering of service\\nRevenue from service is recognized over time by ref erence to the progress \\ntowards satisfaction of each performance obligation . The progress towards \\nsatisfaction of each performance obligation is meas ured by the proportion of \\ncost incurred to date compared to estimated total c ost of each performance \\nobligation. \\nWhere the outcome of a service contract cannot be e stimated reliably, reve -\\nnue is recognized to the extent of cost incurred th at are expected to be recover -\\nable. When it is probable that total contract costs  will exceed total revenue, the \\nexpected loss is recognized as an expense immediate ly. When the value of the \\nservice performed to the customer corresponds direc tly to the right to invoice \\nfor that service, revenue is recognized to the amou nt invoiced. \\nSpecialty rental\\nIncome from specialty rental is recognized on a str aight-line basis over the rental \\nperiod. The specialty rental business is considered  to be a service for the custom -\\ners as this includes a complete solution to the cus tomers to ful/f_ill the customer \\nneeds. Sale of equipment from the specialty rental business is recognized as rev -\\nenue when the control of the asset has been transfe rred to the buyer. Indicators \\nof transfer of control is explained under âGoods so ldâ see page 67. The carrying \\nvalue of the specialty rental equipment sold is rec ognized as cost of sales. Invest -\\nments in and sales of specialty rental equipment ar e included in cash /f_lows from \\noperating activities.\\nContract assets and contract liabilities\\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cas h collections results in billed \\naccount receivables, unbilled receivables (contract  assets), and customer \\nadvances and deposits (contract liabilities) in the  consolidated balance sheet. \\nBilling occurs either as work progresses in accorda nce with agreed-upon con -\\ntractual terms, upon achievement of contractual mil estones or when the con -\\ntrol of the goods has been transferred to the custo mer. Atlas Copco sometimes \\nreceives advances or deposits from customers, befor e revenue is recognized, \\nresulting in contract liabilities. These contract a ssets and contract liabilities are \\nreported in the consolidated balance sheet, in othe r receivables or other liabili -\\nties, on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of  each reporting period. Pay -\\nment terms range from contract to contract and are dependent upon the agree -\\nment with the customer. \\nPractical expedients\\nThe Group has elected to apply the following expedi ents:\\nFor the disclosure of the aggregate amount of the t ransaction price allocated \\nto the performance obligations that are unsatis/f_ied (or partially u nsatis/f_ied) at \\nthe end of the reporting period, the Group does not  disclose the value related to \\nthe following expedients:\\nâ¢ the performance obligation that is part of the con tract that has an original \\nexpected duration of one year or less, and\\nâ¢ the entity has a right to consideration from a cu stomer in an amount that cor -\\nresponds directly with the value to the customer of  the entityâs performance \\ncompleted to date.\\nFor incremental cost of obtaining the contract, the  Group uses the practical expe -\\ndient of recognizing the incremental cost as an exp ense if the amortization period \\nof the asset, that otherwise would have been recogn ized, is one year or less.\\nOther operating income and expenses\\nCommissions received are recognized on an accrual b asis in accordance with the \\n/f_inancial substance of the agreement. Gains and loss es on disposals of an item \\nof non-current tangible and intangible assets are d etermined by comparing the \\nproceeds from disposal with the carrying amount. Se e note 7 for additional \\ninformation.\\nFinancial income and expenses\\nInterest income and interest expenses are recognize d in pro/f_it or loss using the 1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements, continued\\ne/uniFB00ective interest method. Dividend income is recogn ized in pro/f_it or loss on the \\ndate that the Groupâs right to receive payment is e stablished. See note 8 for \\nadditional information.\\nIncome taxes \\nIncome taxes include both current and deferred taxe s. Income taxes are \\nreported in pro/f_it or loss unless the underlying tra nsaction is reported in other \\ncomprehensive income or in equity, in which case th e corresponding tax is \\nreported according to the same principle. \\nA current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or \\nrefundable for the current year or prior years. \\nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet liability method. The cal -\\nculation of deferred taxes is based on di/uniFB00erences b etween the values reported \\nin the balance sheet and their valuation for taxati on, which are referred to as \\ntemporary di/uniFB00erences, and the carry forward of unus ed tax losses and tax cred -\\nits. Temporary di/uniFB00erences attributable to the follo wing assets and liabilities are \\nnot provided for: the initial recognition of goodwi ll, the initial recognition (other \\nthan in business combinations) of assets or liabili ties that a/uniFB00ect neither account -\\ning nor taxable pro/f_it, and di/uniFB00erences related to in vestments in subsidiaries, \\nassociated companies and joint ventures to the exte nt that they will probably \\nnot reverse in the foreseeable future, and for whic h the Company is able to con -\\ntrol the timing of the reversal of the temporary di /uniFB00erences.\\nA deferred tax asset is recognized only to the exte nt that it is probable that \\nfuture taxable pro/f_its will be available against whi ch the asset can be utilized. In \\nthe calculation of deferred taxes, enacted or subst antively enacted tax rates are \\nused for the individual tax jurisdictions. \\nCurrent and deferred tax assets and liabilities are  o/uniFB00set when there is a legally \\nenforceable right to set o/uniFB00 current tax assets agai nst current tax liabilities and \\nwhen they relate to income taxes levied by the same  taxation authority and the \\nGroup intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. For \\ndetails regarding taxes, see note 9.\\nEarnings per share\\nBasic earnings per share are calculated based on th e pro/f_it for the year attribut -\\nable to owners of the parent and the basic weighted  average number of shares \\noutstanding. Diluted earnings per share are calcula ted based on the pro/f_it for \\nthe year attributable to owners of the parent and t he diluted weighted average \\nnumber of shares outstanding. Dilutive e/uniFB00ects arise  from stock options that are \\nsettled in shares, or that at the employeesâ choice  can be settled in shares or cash \\nin the share-based incentive programs. \\nStock options have a dilutive e/uniFB00ect when the averag e share price during the \\nperiod exceeds the exercise price of the options. W hen calculating the dilutive \\ne/uniFB00ect, the exercise price is adjusted by the value of future services related to the \\noptions. If options for which employees can choose settlement in shares or cash \\nare dilutive, the pro/f_it for the year is adjusted fo r the di/uniFB00erence between cash-\\nsettled and equity-settled treatment of options and  the more dilutive of cash \\nsettlement and share settlement is used in calculat ing earnings per share. See \\nnote 11 for more details.\\nIntangible assets\\nGoodwill \\nGoodwill is recognized at cost, as established at t he date of acquisition of a busi -\\nness (see âBusiness combinationsâ), less accumulate d impairment losses, if any. \\nGoodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to \\nbene/f_it from the synergies of the business combinati on. Impairment testing is \\nmade at least annually or whenever the need is indi cated. The impairment test is \\nperformed at the level on which goodwill is monitor ed for internal manage -\\nment purposes. The four business areas of Atlas Cop coâs operations have been \\nidenti/f_ied as CGUs. Goodwill is reported as an inde/f_i nite useful life intangible \\nasset. \\nTechnology-based intangible assets\\nExpenditure on research activities is expensed as i ncurred. Research projects \\nacquired as part of business combinations are initi ally recognized at their fair \\nvalue at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, thes e research \\nprojects are carried at cost less amortization and impairment losses. Expendi -\\nture on development activities are expensed as incu rred unless the activities \\nmeet the criteria for being capitalized i.e.: \\nâ¢ the product or process being developed is estimat ed to be technically and \\ncommercially feasible, and \\nâ¢ the Group has the intent and ability to complete and sell or use the product  \\nor process. \\nThe expenditure capitalized includes the cost of ma terials, direct labor, and \\nother costs directly attributable to the project. C apitalized development expen -\\nditure is carried at cost less accumulated amortiza tion and impairment losses. \\nAmortization related to research and development ex penditure for 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\nAtlas Copco 2019 69amounted to 792 (734). This has been reported as pa rt of research and develop -\\nment costs in the income statement since the Group follows up on the research \\nand development function as a whole.\\nTrademarks\\nTrademarks acquired by the Group are capitalized ba sed on their fair value at \\nthe time of acquisition. Certain trademarks are est imated to have an inde/f_inite \\nuseful life and are carried at cost less accumulate d impairment losses. They are \\ntested at least annually for impairment. Other trad emarks, which have /f_inite \\nuseful lives, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment \\nlosses.\\nMarketing and customer related intangible assets\\nAcquired marketing and customer related intangibles  are capitalized based on \\ntheir fair value at the time of acquisition and are  carried at cost less accumulated \\namortization and impairment losses.\\nOther intangible assets\\nAcquired intangible assets relating to contract-bas ed rights, such as licenses or \\nfranchise agreements, are capitalized based on thei r fair value at the time of \\nacquisition and carried at cost less accumulated am ortization and impairment \\nlosses. Expenditure on internally generated goodwil l, trademarks and similar \\nitems is expensed as incurred. Changes in the Group âs intangible assets during \\nthe year are described in note 12.\\nProperty, plant and equipment \\nItems of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and impairment losses. Cost of an item  of property, plant and \\nequipment comprises purchase price, import duties, and any cost directly attrib -\\nutable to bringing the asset to the location and co ndition for use. The cost also \\nincludes dismantlement and removal of the asset in the future if applicable. Bor -\\nrowing cost for assets that need a substantial peri od of time to get ready for \\ntheir intended use are included in the cost value u ntil the assets are substantially \\nready for their use or sale and are thereafter depr eciated over the useful life of \\nthe asset. The Group capitalizes costs on initial r ecognition and on replacement \\nof signi/f_icant parts of property, plant and equipmen t if it is probable that the \\nfuture economic bene/f_its embodied will /f_low to the Gr oup and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably. All other costs are recognized a s an expense in pro/f_it or loss \\nwhen incurred.\\nRental equipment\\nThe rental /f_leet is comprised of diesel and electric  powered air compressors, \\ngenerators, air dryers, and to a lesser extent gene ral construction equipment. \\nRental equipment is initially recognized at cost an d is depreciated over the esti -\\nmated useful lives of the equipment. Rental equipme nt is depreciated to a resid -\\nual value estimated at 0â10% of cost.\\nDepreciation and amortization \\nDepreciation and amortization are calculated based on cost using the straight-\\nline method over the estimated useful life of the a sset. Parts of property, plant \\nand equipment with a cost that is signi/f_icant in rel ation to the total cost of the \\nitem are depreciated separately when the useful liv es of the parts do not coin -\\ncide with the useful lives of other parts of the it em. The following useful lives are \\nused for depreciation and amortization: \\nTechnology-based intangible assets 3â15 years\\nTrademarks with /f_inite lives 5â15 years \\nMarketing and customer related intangible assets 5â15 years\\nBuildings 25â50 years\\nMachinery and equipment 3â10 years\\nVehicles 4â5 years\\nComputer hardware and software 3â10 years\\nRental equipment 3â8 years\\nThe useful lives and residual values are reassessed  annually. Land, assets under con -\\nstruction, goodwill, and trademarks with inde/f_inite lives are not depreciated or \\namortized. For changes in the Groupâs property, pla nt and equipment see note 13.\\nLease â IFRS 16 \\nTransition method\\nThe Group applies the new standard, IFRS 16, from J anuary 1, 2019. The new \\nstandard replaces IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determi ning whether an Arrange -\\nment contains a Lease. The Group has performed the transition by using the \\nmodi/f_ied retrospective approach, which does not requ ire restatement of  \\ncomparative periods. The comparative information co ntinues to be reported  \\nin accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The accounti ng principles for the com -1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements, continued\\nparative /f_igures are presented below under the headi ng âLease â IAS 17  \\n(comparative /f_igures), page 70. Details of the chang es in accounting policies \\nare presented below.\\nAtlas Copcoâs lease portfolio consists mainly of le ased buildings such as  \\no/uniFB03ce and warehouse premises, vehicles and productio n equipment.\\nGroup as a lessee\\nAs a lessee, the Group has elected to apply a numbe r of practical expedients. \\nRecognition exemptions are set per asset category f or short-term leases and \\nleases for which the underlying asset is of low val ue. Leases that, at the com -\\nmencement date, had a lease term of 12 months or le ss are not recognized as \\nleases in the balance sheet. The Group has elected to apply the exemption for \\nleases for which the underlying asset is of low val ue regarding o/uniFB03ce equipment \\nsuch as printers and computers. \\nAll /f_inance leases are excluded at transition as wel l as leases where the lease \\nterm ends prior to January 1, 2020. For short-term leases and leases where the \\nunderlying asset are of low value, the Group recogn ized lease payments as an \\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the lease ter m. \\nNon-lease components such as service components and  other variable com -\\nponents that do not depend on an index or price are  accounted for as expenses, \\nif they could be separated in the contracts for the  leased asset. In most cases  \\nservice components are variable and based on for ex ample consumption.\\nFor leases of other assets, previously classi/f_ied as  operating leases under IAS \\n17, the Group recognized right-of-use assets and le ase liabilities.\\nLeases previously classi/f_ied as /f_inance leases\\nLeases that were classi/f_ied as /f_inance leases under I AS 17 were determined at \\nthe carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and l ease liability at January 1, \\n2019. \\nGroup as a lessor\\nLessor accounting is substantially unchanged from t he accounting under IAS 17, \\nexcept for sub-lease contracts. Under IFRS 16, sub- lease contracts that were pre -\\nviously classi/f_ied as an operating lease is required  to be assessed with reference \\nto the right-of-use asset instead of the underlying  asset.\\nImpacts on /f_inancial statements \\nAt transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognized an a dditional 3 259 MSEK of right-\\nof-use assets and 3 284 MSEK of lease liabilities. The di/uniFB00erence between right-\\nof-use assets and lease liabilities refers to prepa id or accrued lease payments \\nand /f_inancial lease receivables on agreements from s ubleasing. \\nThe Group discounted lease payments using its incre mental borrowing rate \\nat January 1, 2019, the weighted-average rate for t he Group was 2.2% at transi -\\ntion.

The interest portion of the lease payment remains as \\ncash /f_low from operating activities and is included in net /f_inancial items paid.\\nGroup as lessee\\nRecognition of a lease\\nUpon initiation, contracts are assessed by the Grou p, to determine whether a \\ncontract is, or contains a lease. If the contract c onveys the right to control the use \\nof an identi/f_ied asset for a certain period of time in exchange for consideration, \\nthen it is or contains a lease. The right to contro l the use of an identi/f_iable asset is \\nassessed by the Group based upon if there is an ide nti/f_iable asset, if the Group \\nhas the right to obtain substantially all economic bene/f_its from the use of the \\nasset and if the Group has the right to steer the u se of the asset. The policy is \\napplied to contracts entered into, or changed, on o r after January 1, 2019. The \\nGroup has elected to separate the non-lease compone nts and also elected to \\napply a number of practical expedients with regard to short-term leases and \\nleases for which the underlying asset is of low val ue. In cases where the Group \\nacts as an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its  interests in the head-lease and \\nthe sub-lease separately.\\nMeasurement of a right-of-use asset and lease liabi lity\\nRight-of-use asset\\nOn commencement date, the Group measures the right- of-use asset at cost, \\nwhich includes the following: the initial amount of  the lease liability adjusted for \\nany lease payments made at or before the commenceme nt date, less any lease \\nincentives received and any initial direct costs in curred by the Group as well as \\nan estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in  dismantling and removing \\nthe underlying asset, restoring the site on which i t is located or restoring the \\nunderlying asset to the condition required by the l ease contract. Cost for dis -\\nmantling, removing or restoring the site on which i t is located and/or the under -\\nlying asset is only recognized when the Group incur s an obligation to do so.\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the leas e term, using the straight-\\nline method.  \\nLease liability\\nOn commencement date, the lease liability is measur ed at the present value of \\nthe unpaid lease payments, discounted using the int erest rate implicit in the \\nlease, or if the rate cannot be readily determined,  the Groupâs incremental bor -\\nrowing rate. Lease payments included in the lease l iability comprise of /f_ixed pay -\\nments, variable lease payments that depend on an in dex or a rate, amounts to \\nbe paid under a residual value guarantee and lease payments in an optional \\nrenewal period if the Group is reasonably certain t o exercise an extension option \\nas well as penalties for early termination of a lea se, if the Group is reasonably \\ncertain to terminate early. If there is a purchase option present, this will be \\nincluded if the Group is reasonably certain to exer cise the option. \\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost b y using the e/uniFB00ective interest \\nrate method.\\nShort-term leases and leases for which the underlyi ng asset is of low value\\nThe Group has elected to apply recognition exemptio ns for short-term leases \\nand leases for which the underlying asset is of low  value, for example o/uniFB03ce \\nequipment such as printers and computers. Lease pay ments associated with \\nthose leases are recognized as an expense on a stra ight-line basis over the lease \\nterm. \\nGroup as a lessor\\nAt inception of a lease contract, the Group assess whether the lease is a /f_inance \\nlease or an operating lease. If the lease transfers  substantially all of the risks and \\nrewards incidental to ownership of the asset, it is  considered to be a /f_inance \\nlease; if not, it is an operating lease. Under /f_inan ce leases where the Group acts \\nas lessor, the transaction is recognized as a sale and a lease receivable, compris -\\ning the future minimum lease payments and any resid ual value guaranteed to \\nthe Group. Lease payments are recognized as repayme nt of the lease receivable \\nand interest income. In cases where the Group acts as a lessor under an operat -\\ning lease, the lease payments are included in pro/f_it  or loss on a straight-line basis \\nover the term of the lease. \\nIn cases where the Group acts as an intermediate le ssor, it accounts for its \\ninterests in the head-lease and the sub-lease separ ately. The Group assesses the \\nlease classi/f_ication of a sub-lease with reference t o the right-of-use asset arising \\nfrom the head-lease. \\nLease â IAS 17 (comparative /f_igures)\\nThe Group acts both as lessor and lessee. Leases ar e classi/f_ied as either /f_inance \\nleases or operating leases. A /f_inance lease entails the transfer to the lessee of \\nsubstantially all of the economic risks and bene/f_its  associated with ownership. If \\nthis is not the case, the lease is accounted for as  an operating lease.1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements, continued\\nGroup as lessee\\nFor the Group, a /f_inancial lease implies that the /f_ix ed asset leased is recognized \\nas an asset in the balance sheet. Initially, a corr esponding liability is recorded. \\nUpon initial recognition, the leased asset is measu red at an amount equal to the \\nlower of its fair value and the present value of th e future minimum lease pay -\\nments. Fixed assets under /f_inance leases are depreci ated over their estimated \\nuseful lives, while the lease payments are reported  as interest and amortization \\nof the lease liability. For operating leases, the G roup does not account for the \\nleased asset in its balance sheet. The costs of ope rating leases are recorded in \\nthe income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\nGroup as lessor\\nIn cases where the Group acts as the lessor under a n operating lease, the asset is \\nclassi/f_ied as rental equipment and is subject to the  Groupâs depreciation poli -\\ncies. The lease payments are included in pro/f_it or l oss on a straight-line basis over \\nthe term of the lease. Under /f_inance leases where th e Group acts as lessor, the \\ntransaction is recorded as a sale and a lease recei vable, comprising the future \\nminimum lease payments and any residual value guara nteed to the Group. \\nLease payments are recognized as interest income an d repayment of the lease \\nreceivable. See note 22 for more details on leases.\\nImpairment of non-/f_inancial assets\\nThe carrying values of the Groupâs non-/f_inancial ass ets are reviewed at least at \\neach reporting date to determine whether there is a ny indication of impair -\\nment. If any such indication exists, the Group esti mates the recoverable amount \\nof the asset. An impairment loss is recognized if t he carrying amount of an asset \\nor its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recov erable amount (i.e. the \\ngreater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). In assessing the value in \\nuse, the estimated future cash /f_lows are discounted to their present value using \\na discount rate that re/f_lects current market assessm ents of the time value of \\nmoney and the risks speci/f_ic to the asset or CGU. Fo r the purpose of assessing \\nimpairment, assets are grouped in CGUs, which are t he smallest identi/f_iable \\ngroups of assets that generate cash in/f_lows that are  largely independent of the \\ncash in/f_lows from other assets or group of assets. I mpairment losses are recog -\\nnized in pro/f_it or loss. An impairment loss related to goodwill is not reversed. In \\nrespect of other assets, impairment losses in prior  periods are reviewed for pos -\\nsible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\\nInventories\\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net  realizable value. Net realiz -\\nable value is the estimated selling price for inven tories less all estimated costs of \\ncompletion and costs necessary to make the sale. In ventories are recognized \\naccording to the /f_irst-in, /f_irst-out principle and in cludes the cost of acquiring \\ninventories and bringing them to their existing loc ation and condition. Invento -\\nries manufactured by the Group and work in progress  include an appropriate \\nshare of production overheads based on normal opera ting capacity. Inventories \\nare reported net of deductions for obsolescence and  internal pro/f_its arising in \\nconnection with deliveries from the production comp anies to the customer cen -\\nters. See note 16 for more details.\\nEquity \\nShares issued by the company are classi/f_ied as equit y. Incremental costs directly \\nattributable to the issue of ordinary shares and sh are options are recognized as \\na deduction from equity, net of any tax e/uniFB00ect.\\nWhen Atlas Copco shares are repurchased, the amount  of the consideration \\npaid is recognized as a deduction from equity net o f any tax e/uniFB00ect. Repurchased \\nshares are classi/f_ied as treasury shares and are pre sented as a deduction from \\ntotal equity. When treasury shares are sold or subs equently reissued, the \\namount received is recognized as an increase in equ ity and the resulting surplus \\nor de/f_icit on the transaction is transferred to or f rom Other paid-in capital. \\nSupply chain /f_inancing\\nThe Group and Banks, with close relations to Atlas Copco, o/uniFB00er suppliers the \\nopportunity to use a supply chain /f_inancing scheme ( âSCFâ) which allows them \\nto be paid earlier than the invoice due date. The G roup evaluates supplier \\narrangements against a number of indicators to asse ss if the payable continues \\nto hold characteristics of a trade payable or shoul d be classi/f_ied as borrowings; \\nthese indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary pay -\\nment terms in the industry. These transactions has been recognized as either \\nâAccount payablesâ or âBorrowingsâ in the Groupâs b alance sheet and as \\nâChange in operating liabilitiesâ or change in âBor rowingsâ or âRepayment of \\nborrowingsâ in the statement of cash /f_lows. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\nAtlas Copco 2019 71Provisions\\nProvisions are recognized:\\nâ¢  when the Group has a legal or constructive oblig ation as a result of a  \\npast event, \\nâ¢ it is probable that the Group will have to settle  the obligation, and \\nâ¢ the amount of the obligation can be estimated rel iably. \\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best es timate of the consideration \\nrequired to settle the present obligation at the ba lance sheet date. \\nIf the e/uniFB00ect of the time value of money is material , the provision is deter -\\nmined by discounting the expected future cash /f_lows of estimated expendi -\\ntures.\\nProvisions for product warranties are recognized as  cost of sales at the time \\nthe products are sold based on the estimated cost u sing historical data for level \\nof repairs and replacements.\\nA restructuring provision is recognized when the Gr oup has approved a \\ndetailed and formal restructuring plan and the rest ructuring has either com -\\nmenced or been announced publicly.\\nPresent obligations arising under onerous contracts  are recognized as provi -\\nsions. An onerous contract is considered to exist w here the Group has a contract \\nunder which the unavoidable costs of meeting the ob ligations under the con -\\ntract exceed the economic bene/f_its expected to be re ceived from the contract. \\nBefore a provision is established, the Group recogn izes any impairment loss on \\nthe asset associated with the contract. For details  on provisions see note 25. \\nPost-employment bene/f_its\\nPost-employment bene/f_it plans are classi/f_ied either a s de/f_ined contribution or \\nde/f_ined bene/f_it plans. Under a de/f_ined contribution pl an, the Group pays /f_ixed \\ncontributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obli -\\ngation to pay further amounts if the fund does not hold su/uniFB03cient assets to pay \\nall employee bene/f_its. Contributions to de/f_ined contr ibutions plans are \\nexpensed when employees provide services entitling them to the contribution. \\nOther post-employment bene/f_it plans are de/f_ined bene/f_i t plans and it is the \\nGroupâs obligation to provide agreed bene/f_its to cur rent and former employees. \\nThe net obligation of de/f_ined bene/f_it plans is calcul ated by estimating the \\namount of future bene/f_its that employees have earned  in return for their ser -\\nvices in current and prior periods. The amount is d iscounted to determine its \\npresent value and the fair values of any plan asset s are deducted. Funded plans \\nwith net assets, i.e. plans with assets exceeding t he commitments, are reported \\nas /f_inancial non-current assets. \\nThe cost for de/f_ined bene/f_it plans is calculated usin g the Projected Unit Credit \\nMethod, which distributes the cost over the employe eâs service period. The cal -\\nculation is performed annually by independent actua ries using actuarial \\nassumptions such as employee turnover, mortality, f uture increase in salaries \\nand medical cost. Changes in actuarial assumptions,  experience adjustments of \\nobligations and changes in fair value of plan asset s result in remeasurements \\nand are recognized in other comprehensive income. E ach quarter a remeasure -\\nment is performed to adjust the present value of pe nsion liabilities and the fair \\nvalue of pension assets against other comprehensive  income. Net interest on \\nde/f_ined bene/f_it obligations and plan assets is report ed as interest income or \\ninterest expenses. See note 23 for additional infor mation.\\nShare-based compensation \\nThe Group has share-based incentive programs, consi sting of share options and \\nshare appreciation rights, which have been o/uniFB00ered t o certain employees based \\non position and performance. Additionally, the Boar d is o/uniFB00ered synthetic \\nshares. The fair value of share options that can on ly be settled in shares (equity-\\nsettled) is recognized as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in \\nequity. The fair value, measured at grant date usin g the Black-Scholes formula, is \\nrecognized as an expense over the vesting period. T he amount recognized as an \\nexpense is adjusted to re/f_lect the actual number of share options that vest. The \\nfair value of the share appreciation rights, synthe tic shares, and options with a \\nchoice for employees to settle in shares or cash is  recognized in accordance with \\nprinciples for cash-settled share-based payments. T he value is recognized as an \\nemployee expense with a corresponding increase in l iabilities. The fair value, \\nmeasured at grant date and remeasured at each repor ting date using the Black-\\nScholes formula, is accrued and recognized as an ex pense over the vesting \\nperiod. Changes in fair value are, during the vesti ng period and after the vesting \\nperiod until settlement, recognized in pro/f_it or los s as an employee expense. \\nThe accumulated expense recognized equals the cash amount paid at settle -\\nment. \\nSocial security charges are paid in cash and are ac counted for in consistence \\nwith the principles for cash-settled share-based pa yments, regardless of \\nwhether they are related to equity- or cash-settled  share-based payments.

Trade receivables are recognized on \\nissuance of invoices. Liabilities are recognized wh en the other party has per -\\nformed and there is a contractual obligation to pay . Derecognition, fully or par -\\ntially, of a /f_inancial asset occurs when the rights in the contract have been real -\\nized or mature, or when the Group no longer has con trol over it. A /f_inancial lia -\\nbility is derecognized, fully or partially, when th e obligation speci/f_ied in the con -\\ntract is discharged or otherwise expires.

In addition, the \\nimpairment model applies to contract assets, loan c ommitments and /f_inancial \\nguarantees that are not measured at FVTPL. The IFRS  9 expected credit loss \\n(ECL) model is forward looking and a loss allowance  is recognized when there is \\nan exposure to credit risk, usually at /f_irst recogni tion of an asset or receivable. \\nThe ECL re/f_lects the present value of all cash short falls related to default events \\neither over the following 12 months or over the exp ected life of a /f_inancial \\ninstrument, depending on the type of asset and on t he credit deterioration from \\ninception. The ECL re/f_lects an unbiased, probability -weighted outcome that \\nconsiders multiple scenarios based on reasonable an d supportable forecasts. \\nThe simpli/f_ied model is applied on trade receivables , lease receivables, con -\\ntract assets and certain other /f_inancial receivables . A loss allowance is recog -\\nnized over the expected lifetime of the receivable or asset. For other items sub -\\nject to ECL, the impairment model with a three-stag e approach is applied. Ini -\\ntially, and at each reporting date, a loss allowanc e will be recognized for the fol -\\nlowing 12 months, or a shorter time period dependin g on the time to maturity \\n(stage 1). If it has been a signi/f_icant increase in credit risk since origination, a loss \\nallowance will be recognized for the remaining life time of the asset (stage 2). \\nFor assets that are considered as credit impaired, allowance for credit losses will \\ncontinue to capture the lifetime expected credit lo sses (stage 3). For credit \\nimpaired receivables and assets, the interest reven ue is calculated based on the \\ncarrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allow ance, rather than its gross car -\\nrying amount as in previous stages.\\nIn the respective model applied, the measurement of  ECL is based on di/uniFB00er -\\nent methods for di/uniFB00erent credit risk exposures. For  trade receivables, contract \\nassets and certain other /f_inancial receivables, the method is based on historical \\nloss rates in combination with forward looking cons iderations. Lease receiv -\\nables, certain other /f_inancial receivables and cash and cash equivalent are \\nimpaired by a rating method, where ECL is measured by the product of the prob -\\nability of default, loss given default, and exposur e at default. Both external \\ncredit agencies rating and internally developed rat ing methods are applied. \\nThe measurement of ECL considers potential collater als and other credit \\nenhancements in the form of guarantees.\\nThe /f_inancial assets are presented in the /f_inancial s tatements at amortized \\ncost, i.e. net of gross carrying amount and the los s allowance. Changes in the \\nloss allowance is recognized in pro/f_it or loss as im pairment losses.\\nDerivatives and hedge accounting\\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract \\nis entered into and are subsequently measured at fa ir value. The method of rec -\\nognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whet her the derivative is desig -\\nnated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the natur e of the item hedged. \\nChanges in fair value for derivatives that do not f ul/f_ill the criteria for hedge \\naccounting are recognized as operating or /f_inancial transactions based on the \\npurpose of the use of the derivative. Interest paym ents for interest rate swaps \\nare recognized as interest income or expense, where as changes in fair value of \\nfuture payments are presented as gains or losses fr om /f_inancial instruments. \\nIFRS 9 Hedge accounting is applied. In order to qua lify for hedge accounting  \\nthe hedging relationship must be:1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements, continued\\nâ¢ formally identi/f_ied and designated,\\nâ¢ expected to ful/f_il the e/uniFB00ectiveness requirements, and\\nâ¢ documented.\\nThe Group assesses, evaluates, and documents e/uniFB00ecti veness both at hedge \\ninception and on an ongoing basis. Hedge e/uniFB00ectivene ss is assessed by an analy -\\nsis of the economic relationship between the hedged  item and the hedging \\ninstrument, and the e/uniFB00ect of credit risk must not d ominate the value changesâ \\nthat result from that economic relationship. Furthe r, the hedge ratio, as de/f_ined \\nin the GroupÂ´s risk management strategy, must be th e same in the hedging rela -\\ntionship as in the actually hedge performed. \\nCash /f_low hedges:  Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrumen t are rec -\\nognized in other comprehensive income to the extent  that the hedge is e/uniFB00ective \\nand the accumulated changes in fair value are recog nized as a separate compo -\\nnent in equity. Gains or losses relating to the ine /uniFB00ective part of hedges are rec -\\nognized immediately in pro/f_it or loss. \\nThe amount recognized in equity through other compr ehensive income is \\nreversed to pro/f_it or loss in the same period in whi ch the hedged item a/uniFB00ects \\npro/f_it or loss. However, when the hedged forecast tr ansaction results in the rec -\\nognition of a non-/f_inancial asset or a non-/f_inancial liability, the amount previ -\\nously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is \\ntransferred from equity and included in the initial  measurement of the cost of \\nthe non-/f_inancial asset or liability. The Group uses  foreign currency forwards to \\nhedge part of the future cash /f_lows from forecasted transactions in foreign cur -\\nrencies. Interest rate swaps are also used as cash /f_low hedges for hedging inter -\\nest on borrowings with variable interest.\\nHedge of net investments in foreign operations:  The Group hedges a substantial \\npart of net investments in foreign operations. Chan ges in the value of the hedge \\ninstrument relating to the e/uniFB00ective portion of the hedge are recognized in other \\ncomprehensive income and accumulated in equity. Gai ns or losses relating to \\nthe ine/uniFB00ective portion are recognized immediately i n pro/f_it or loss. On divest -\\nment of foreign operations, the gain or loss accumu lated in equity is recycled \\nthrough pro/f_it or loss, increasing or decreasing the  pro/f_it or loss on the divest -\\nment. The Group uses loans and forward contracts as  hedging instruments.\\nAccounting for discontinuation of hedges: Hedge accounting may not be  \\nvoluntarily discontinued. Hedge accounting is disco ntinued: \\nâ¢  when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, \\nâ¢  when there is no longer an economic relationship  between the hedged item \\nand the hedging instrument or the e/uniFB00ect of credit r isk dominates the value \\nchanges that result from the economic relationship,  or \\nâ¢ when the hedge accounting no longer meets the ris k management  \\nobjectives. \\nFor cash /f_low hedges, any gain or loss recognized in  other comprehensive \\nincome and accumulated in equity at the time of hed ge discontinuation remains \\nin equity and is recognized when the forecast trans action is ultimately recog -\\nnized in pro/f_it or loss. When a forecast transaction  is no longer expected to \\noccur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is re cognized immediately in pro/f_it \\nor loss. For net investment hedges, any gain and lo ss recognized in other com -\\nprehensive income and accumulated in equity at the time of hedge discontinua -\\ntion remains in equity until divestment of foreign operations, when the gain or \\nloss accumulated in equity is recycled through pro/f_i t or loss. \\nAssets held for sale and discontinued operations\\nAssets are classi/f_ied as held for sale if their valu e, within one year, will be recov -\\nered through a sale and not through continued use i n the operations. On the \\nreclassi/f_ication date, assets and liabilities are me asured at the lower of fair value \\nless selling expenses and the carrying amount. Gain s and losses recognized on \\nremeasurements and disposals are reported in pro/f_it or loss.  \\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Grou p that either has been \\ndisposed of, or is classi/f_ied as held for sale, and represents a separate major line \\nof business or geographical area of operations. A d iscontinued operation is \\nreported separately from continuing operations in th e income statement with \\nthe corresponding presentation for the comparative period. In the balance \\nsheet assets held for sale and associated liabiliti es are reported separately, the \\ncomparative period is not a/uniFB00ected. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower \\nof carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell .\\nEpiroc was distributed during 2018 and has been rec ognized according to  \\nthe rules concerning discontinued operations (IFRS 5). Epirocâs pro/f_it for the com -\\nparative period and up to the distribution and the capital gain generated by the \\ndistribution have been recognized in the line â Pro /f_it from discontinued opera -\\ntions, net of tax.

Furthermore, in applying  IFRS 9 to long-term inter -\\nests in associates and joint ventures, an entity do es not take into account adjust -\\nments to their carrying amount required by IAS 28 ( i.e. adjustments to the carry -\\ning amount of long-term interests in associates and  joint ventures arising from \\nthe allocation of losses of the investee or assessm ent of impairment in accor -\\ndance with IAS 28). \\nAmendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Nega tive Compensation\\nThe amendment to IFRS 9 clari/f_ies which /f_inancial ass et may be measured at \\namortized cost. This amendment permits more assets to be measured at amor -\\ntized cost than previously allowed, in particular c ertain pre-payable /f_inancial \\nassets with negative compensation. To qualify for t he amortized cost measure -\\nment, the negative compensation must be reasonable compensation for early \\ntermination of the contract. To be applicable for s uch handling, the asset must \\nbe held within a âhold to collectâ business model.\\n This amendment also clari/f_ies that when there are m odi/f_ications relating to a \\n/f_inancial liability measured at amortized cost, whic h do not lead to derecogni -\\ntion of the /f_inancial liability, a gain or loss shou ld be recognized in the pro/f_it and \\nloss. This gain or loss is calculated by comparing the initial contractual cash /f_low \\nwith the modi/f_ied cash /f_low discounted at the origina l e/uniFB00ective interest rate. \\nAmendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment o r Settlement \\nThe amendment clari/f_ies that the Group must, if a pl an amendment, curtail -\\nment or settlement occurs, determine the current se rvice cost and the net inter -\\nest for the period using the assumptions it used fo r the remeasurement. Fur -\\nthermore, the amendment clari/f_ies the e/uniFB00ect of a pla n amendment, curtailment \\nor settlement on the requirements regarding the ass et ceiling.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\n74 Atlas Copco 2019CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS \\nThe preparation of /f_inancial reports requires manage mentâs judgement and the \\nuse of estimates and assumptions that a/uniFB00ects the am ounts reported in the con -\\nsolidated /f_inancial statements. These estimates and associated assumptions are \\nbased on historical experience and various other fa ctors that are believed to be \\nreasonable under the prevailing circumstances. Actu al result may di/uniFB00er from \\nthose estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going \\nbasis. Changes in accounting estimates are recogniz ed in the period which they \\nare revised in and in any future periods a/uniFB00ected.\\nThe estimates and the judgements which, in the opin ion of management, are \\nsigni/f_icant to the underlying amounts included in th e /f_inancial reports and for \\nwhich there is a signi/f_icant risk that future events  or new information could \\nentail a change in those estimates or judgements ar e as follows:\\nRevenue recognition\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nRevenue for services and for highly customized good s where an enforceable \\nright of payment is present is recognized over time  in pro/f_it or loss by reference \\nto the progress towards satisfaction of the perform ance obligation at the bal -\\nance sheet date. The progress towards satisfaction is determined by the propor -\\ntion of cost incurred to date compared to the estim ated total cost of each per -\\nformance obligation. There is always an uncertainty  if the total estimated \\nexpenditure is correctly calculated, and if the exp enditure incurred re/f_lects \\naccurately the actual costs incurred, which means t hat there is uncertainty in the \\nestimates of the degree of completion of the work p erformed. Management \\nhas assessed this method of determining the progres s towards satisfaction of \\nthe performance obligation as most suitable as it r e/f_lects the progression of \\nwork performed, and the enforceable right of paymen t from the customer as \\nthe costs are incurred on the performance obligatio ns. \\nRevenue for goods sold is recognized in pro/f_it or lo ss at one point in time \\nwhen control of the good has been transferred to th e customer. \\nAccounting judgement\\nManagementâs judgement is used, for instance, when assessing:\\nâ¢ the degree of progress towards satisfaction of th e performance obligations \\nand the estimated total costs for such contracts wh en revenue is recognized \\nover time, to determine the revenue and cost to be recognized in the current \\nperiod, and whether any losses need to be recognize d, \\nâ¢ if the control has been transferred to the custom er (for example the Group has \\na present right to payment for the good, the custom er has legal title of the \\ngood, the good has been delivered to the customer a nd/or the customer has \\nthe signi/f_icant risks and rewards of the ownership o f the good), to determine \\nif revenue and cost should be recognized in the cur rent period,\\nâ¢ the transaction price of each performance obligat ion when a contract \\nincludes more than one performance obligation, to d etermine the revenue \\nand cost to be recognized in the current period,\\nâ¢ certain contracts which include a right of return  and/or volume rebates that \\ngive rise to variable consideration, variable consi deration is assessed to iden -\\ntify possible constrains, and\\nâ¢ the customer credit risk (i.e. the risk that the customer will not meet the  \\npayment obligation), to determine and justify the r evenue recognized in the \\ncurrent period. \\nImpairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and  other  \\nlong-lived assets\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nGoodwill and certain trademarks are not amortized b ut are subject to annual \\ntests for impairment. Other intangible assets and o ther long-lived assets are \\namortized or depreciated based on managementâs esti mates of the period that \\nthe assets will generate revenue but are also revie wed regularly for indications \\nof impairment. The impairment tests are based on a review of the recoverable \\namount, which is estimated based on managementâs pr ojections of future cash \\n/f_lows using internal business plans and forecasts. Accounting judgement\\nAsset impairment requires managementâs judgement, p articularly in assessing: \\nâ¢  whether an event has occurred that may a/uniFB00ect ass et values, \\nâ¢ whether the carrying value of an asset can be sup ported by the net present \\nvalue of future cash /f_lows, which are estimated base d upon the continued use \\nof the asset in the business,  \\nâ¢ the appropriate assumptions to be applied in prep aring cash /f_low projections, \\nand\\nâ¢ the discounting of these cash /f_lows.\\nChanging the assumptions selected by management to determine the level, if \\nany, of impairment could a/uniFB00ect the /f_inancial positio n and results of operation. \\nSee note 12.\\nDeferred taxes\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for temporary di /uniFB00erences between the car -\\nrying amounts for /f_inancial reporting purposes of as sets and liabilities and the \\namounts used for taxation purposes and for tax loss  carry-forwards. The Group \\nrecords deferred tax assets based upon managementâs  estimates of future tax -\\nable pro/f_it in di/uniFB00erent tax jurisdictions. The actua l results may di/uniFB00er from these \\nestimates, due to change in the business climate an d change in tax legislation. \\nSee note 9.\\nInventory\\nAccounting judgement\\nThe Group values inventory at the lower of historic al cost, based on the /f_irst-in, \\n/f_irst-out basis, and net realizable value. The calcu lation of net realizable value \\ninvolves managementâs judgement on the estimated sa les prices, over-stock \\narticles, outdated articles, damaged goods, and sel ling costs. If the estimated \\nnet realizable value is lower than cost, a valuatio n allowance is established for \\ninventory obsolescence. See note 16 for additional information.\\nLeases \\nAccounting judgement \\nThe Group has several lease contracts that include extension options. The Group \\napplies judgement in evaluating the lease term, it considers all facts and circum -\\nstances that create an economic incentive to exerci se an extension option. \\nExtension options are only included in the lease te rm if the lease is reasonably \\ncertain to be extended. For leases of premises, the  following factors are nor -\\nmally the most relevant:\\nâ¢ If any leasehold improvements are expected to hav e a signi/f_icant remaining \\nvalue, the Group is typically reasonably certain to  extend.\\nâ¢ Otherwise, the Group considers other factors incl uding historical lease dura -\\ntions and the costs and business disruption require d to replace the leased \\nasset.\\nThe renewal periods for leases of o/uniFB03ces and warehou se premises with exten -\\nsion options exceeding 10 to 15 years are not inclu ded as part of the lease term \\nas these are not reasonably certain to be exercised . In addition, renewal options \\nfor leases of motor vehicles are not part of the le ase term because the Group \\ntypically leases motor vehicles for not more than t hree to /f_ive years and, hence, is \\nnot exercising any renewal options. \\n After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is \\na signi/f_icant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and \\na/uniFB00ects its ability to exercise the option to renew.  Refer to note 22 for informa -\\ntion on potential future rental payments relating t o extension options that are \\nnot included in the lease term. \\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty: \\nWhen the Group cannot readily determine the interes t rate implicit in the lease, \\nit uses incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure  lease liabilities. The IBR is \\nthe rate of interest that the Group would have to p ay to borrow over similar \\nterms which requires estimations when no observable  rates are available. The \\nGroup estimates the IBR by using market interest ra tes and adjusting with entity \\nspeci/f_ic estimates such as currency and country risk .1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements, continuedFINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\nAtlas Copco 2019 751. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements, continued\\nTrade and /f_inancial receivable \\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty: \\nThe Group measure the expected credit losses on /f_ina ncial assets classi/f_ied at \\namortized cost including trade and /f_inancial receiva bles, lease receivables and \\ncontract assets. The expected credit losses for tra de receivables and contract \\nassets are an assessment of speci/f_ic loss provisions  corresponding to individually \\nsigni/f_icant exposures as well as historical loss rat es in combination with forward \\nlooking considerations. The expected credit losses for lease receivables and \\n/f_inancial receivables are an assessment that re/f_lects  an unbiased, probability-\\nweighted outcome based on reasonable and supportabl e forecasts. \\nAccounting judgement:  \\nManagementâs judgement considers rapidly changing m arket conditions. An \\noverlay control is performed to ensure that an adeq uate loss allowance is recog -\\nnized. Additional information is included in sectio n âCredit riskâ in note 27.  \\nPension and other post-employment bene/f_it valuation assumptions\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nPensions and other post-employment obligations are dependent on the \\nassumptions established by management and used by a ctuaries in calculating \\nsuch amounts. The key assumptions include discount rates, in/f_lation, future  \\nsalary increases, mortality rates, and healthcare-c ost trend rates. The actuarial \\nassumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and are  changed when it is \\ndeemed appropriate. \\nSee note 23 for additional information regarding as sumptions used in the \\ncalculation of pension and post-employment obligations. Legal proceedings and tax claims\\nAccounting judgement \\nAtlas Copco recognizes a liability when the Group h as an obligation from a past \\nevent involving the transfer of economic bene/f_its an d when a reasonable esti -\\nmate can be made of what the transfer might be. The  Group reviews outstand -\\ning legal cases regularly in order to assess the ne ed for provisions in the /f_inancial \\nstatements. These reviews consider the factors of t he speci/f_ic case by internal \\nlegal counsel and through the use of outside legal counsel and advisors when \\nnecessary. The /f_inancial statements may be a/uniFB00ected t o the extent that manage -\\nmentâs assessments of the factors considered are no t consistent with the actual \\noutcome.\\nAdditionally, the legal entities of the Group are f requently subject to audits \\nby tax authorities in accordance with standard prac tice in the countries where \\nthe Group operates. In instances where the tax auth orities have a di/uniFB00erent view \\non how to interpret the tax legislation, the Group makes estimates as to the like -\\nlihood of the outcome of the dispute, as well as es timates of potential claims. \\nThe actual results may di/uniFB00er from these estimates.\\nWarranty provisions\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nProvisions for product warranties should cover futu re commitments for the \\nsales volumes already realized. Warranty provisions  are complex accounting \\nestimates due to the variety of variables which are  included in the calculations. \\nThe calculation methods are based on the type of pr oducts sold and historical \\ndata for level of repairs and replacements. The und erlying estimates for  \\ncalculating the provision are reviewed at least qua rterly as well as when new \\nproducts are introduced or when other changes occur  which may a/uniFB00ect the  \\ncalculation.

Employee bene/f_its\\nPost-employment bene/f_its\\nAtlas Copco provides post-employment de/f_ined bene/f_it pensions and other \\nlong-term employee bene/f_its in most of its major loc ations. The most signi/f_icant \\ncountries in terms of size of plans are Belgium, Ge rmany, Sweden, the United \\nKingdom and the United States. Some plans are funde d in advance with certain \\nassets or funds held separately from the Group for future bene/f_it payment obli -\\ngations. Other plans are unfunded and the bene/f_its f rom those plans are paid by \\nthe Group as they fall due. \\nThe plans in Belgium cover early retirement, jubile e, and termination indem -\\nnity and are all unfunded. \\nIn Canada, the pension plan and the supplemental re tirement pension bene -\\n/f_it plan for executives, both funded, were wound up in 2019. There are also two \\nunfunded plans, a post-retirement bene/f_it plan and a  post-employment plan. \\nThe plans in Germany cover pensions, early retireme nts and jubilee. The plans \\nare funded. \\nThere are three de/f_ined bene/f_it pension plans in Swed en. The ITP plan is a \\n/f_inal salary pension plan covering the majority of w hite-collar employees in \\nSweden. Atlas Copco /f_inances the bene/f_its through a p ension foundation. The \\nsecond plan relates to a group of employees earning  more than ten income base \\namounts that has opted out from the ITP plan. This plan is insured. The third \\nde/f_ined bene/f_it pension plan relates to former senior  employees now retired. In \\nSweden, in addition to bene/f_its relating to retireme nt pensions, Atlas Copco has \\nobligations for family pensions for many of the Swe dish employees, which are \\nfunded through a third-party insurer, Alecta. This plan is accounted for as a \\nde/f_ined contribution plan as su/uniFB03cient information fo r calculating the net pen -\\nsion obligation is not available. \\nIn the United Kingdom, there is a /f_inal salary pensi on plan.

Employee bene/f_its, continued\\nShare value based incentive programs\\nIn 2015â2018, the Annual General Meeting decided on  performance-based \\npersonnel stock option programs based on a proposal  from the Board on an \\noption program for the respective years. In 2019, t he Annual General Meeting \\ndecided on a performance-based personnel stock opti on program for 2019  \\nsimilar to the 2015â2018 programs. \\nOption programs 2015â2019\\nAt the Annual General Meeting 2015â2019 respectivel y, it was decided to \\nimplement performance-based personnel stock option programs. The decision \\nto grant options was made in April each year and th e options were issued in \\nMarch the following year (issue date). The number o f options issued for each \\nprogram year depended on the value creation in the Group, measured as Eco -\\nnomic Value Added (EVA), for the respective program  year. For the 2019 option \\nprogram, the number of options varies on a linear b asis within a preset EVA \\ninterval. The size of the plan and the limits of th e interval have been established \\nby the Board and have been approved by the Annual G eneral Meeting and are \\ncompatible with the long-term business plan of the Group.\\nIn connection to the issue, the exercise price was calculated as 110% of the \\naverage trading price for series A shares during a ten-day period following the \\ndate of the publishing of the fourth quarter report . The options were issued \\nwithout compensation paid by the employee and the o ptions remain the prop -\\nerty of the employee only to the extent that they a re exercisable at the time \\nemployment is terminated. The 2015 program has a te rm of /f_ive years from the \\ngrant date whereas the 2016â2019 programs have a te rm of seven years. The \\noptions in the 2014â2019 programs are not transfera ble and become exercis -\\nable at 100% three years after grant.\\nThe 2015â2019 programs include a requirement for se nior executives (31 in \\ntotal) to purchase Atlas Copco A shares for 10% of their gross base salary in \\norder to be granted options. A lower amount of inve stment will reduce the \\nnumber of options proportionately. Further, senior executives who have \\ninvested in Atlas Copco A shares will have the opti on to purchase one matching \\nshare per each share purchased at a price equal to 75% of the average trading \\nprice for series A shares during a ten-day period f ollowing the date of the pub -\\nlishing of the fourth quarter report. This right ap plies from three years after \\ngrant until the expiration of the stock option prog ram. \\nThe Board had the right to decide to implement an a lternative incentive solu -\\ntion (SARs) for key persons in such countries where  the grant of personnel \\noptions was not feasible. \\nIn the 2015â2018 programs, the options may, on requ est by an optionee in \\nSweden, be settled by the Company paying cash equal  to the excess of the clos -\\ning price of the shares over the exercise price on the exercise day, less any admin -\\nistrative fees. Due to this choice of settlement by  the Swedish employees, these \\noptions are classi/f_ied for accounting purposes as ca sh-settled in accordance \\nwith IFRS 2.The Black-Scholes model is used to calculate the fa ir value of the options/SARs in \\nthe programs at issue date.

The values of these net positions /f_luctuate subject to \\nchanges in currency rates and, thus, render transac tion exposure for the Group.  \\nPolicy\\nThe Groupâs policy states that exposure shall be re duced by matching in and \\nout/f_lows of the same currencies. Business area and d ivisional management are \\nresponsible for maintaining readiness to adjust the ir operations (price and cost) \\nto compensate for adverse currency movements. Based  on the assumption that \\nhedging does not have any signi/f_icant e/uniFB00ect on the G roupâs long-term result, \\nthe policy recommends to leave transaction exposure s unhedged on an ongo -\\ning basis. In general, business areas and divisions  shall not hedge currency risks. \\nThe Financial Risk Management Committee can decide to hedge part of the \\ntransaction exposure. Transactions shall then quali fy for hedge accounting in \\naccordance with IFRS and hedging beyond 18 months i s not allowed. Financial \\ntransaction exposure is fully hedged. \\nStatus at year end\\nThe Group has continued to manage transaction expos ures primarily by match -\\ning in- and out/f_lows in the same currencies. Graph 1  shows the net of in- and \\nout/f_lows per currency for currencies which have the largest surplus or de/f_icit. \\nThe operational transaction exposure is de/f_ined as t he net operational cash \\n/f_low exposure and amounts to MSEK  â4 711(â4 670). The estimated amounts \\nare based on the Groupâs operational external payme nts from customers and to \\nsuppliers. \\nThe transaction exposure sensitivity analysis is ba sed on the operational \\ntransaction exposure.

Each business un it is required to have  \\nan approved commercial risk policy.\\nProvision for credit risks\\nThe business units establish provisions for their e xpected credit losses in respect \\nof trade and other receivables. The IFRS 9 expected  credit loss (ECL) model is for -\\nward looking and a loss allowance is recognized whe n there is an exposure to \\ncredit risk. For assets such as trade receivables, lease receivables, contract assets \\nand certain other /f_inancial receivables, the simpli/f_i ed model is applied.

COMPANY\\nNotes to the Parent Company\\n/f_inancial statements\\nMSEK unless otherwise stated\\nA1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles\\nAtlas Copco AB is the ultimate Parent Company of th e Atlas Copco Group and is \\nheadquartered in Nacka, Sweden. Its operations incl ude administrative func -\\ntions, holding company functions as well as parts o f Atlas Copco Financial Solu -\\ntions (Treasury).  \\nThe /f_inancial statements of Atlas Copco AB have been  prepared in accordance \\nwith the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the recomm endation RFR 2, \\nâAccounting for Legal Entitiesâ, hereafter referred  to as âRFR 2â, issued by the \\nSwedish Financial Reporting Board. In accordance wi th RFR 2, parent companies \\nthat issue consolidated /f_inancial statements according to International  Financial \\nReporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the Euro pean Union, shall present \\ntheir /f_inancial statements in accordance with IFRS, to the extent these account -\\ning principles comply with the Swedish Annual Accou nts Act and may use \\nexemptions from IFRS provided by RFR 2 due to Swedi sh accounting or tax legis -\\nlation. \\nThe /f_inancial statements are presented in Swedish kr ona (SEK), rounded to \\nthe nearest million. The parent companyâs accountin g principles have been con -\\nsistently applied to all periods presented unless o therwise stated. The /f_inancial \\nstatements are prepared using the same accounting p rinciples as described in \\nnote 1 in the Groupâs consolidated /f_inancial stateme nts, except for those dis -\\nclosed in the following sections.\\nFor discussion regarding accounting estimates and j udgments, see page 74.\\nSubsidiaries\\nParticipations in subsidiaries are accounted for by  the Parent Company at histor -\\nical cost. The carrying amounts of participations i n subsidiaries are reviewed for \\nimpairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of  Assets. See the Groupâs \\naccounting policies, Impairment of /f_inancial assets,  for further details.\\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with a bus iness combination are \\naccounted for by the Parent Company as part of the acquisition costs and are \\nnot expensed.\\nLease contracts\\nAll lease contracts entered into by the Parent Comp any are expensed \\ncontinously on a stright-line basis over the lease term. Leases are not carried as \\nassets, since the risk and rewards associated with ownership of the assets have \\nnot been transferred to the Parent Company.\\nEmployee bene/f_its \\nDe/f_ined bene/f_it plans\\nDe/f_ined bene/f_it plans are not accounted for in accord ance with IAS 19. In  \\nthe Parent Company de/f_ined bene/f_it plans are accounte d for according to the \\nSwedish law regarding pensions, âTryggandelagenâ an d regulations issued by \\nthe Swedish Financial Supervisory Board. The primar y di/uniFB00erences as compared \\nto IAS 19 are the way discount rates are /f_ixed, that  the calculation of de/f_ined \\nbene/f_it obligations is based on current salary level s, without consideration of \\nfuture salary increases and that all actuarial gain s and losses are included in \\npro/f_it or loss as they occur. \\nShare-based payments\\nThe share-based payments that the Parent Company ha s granted to employees \\nin the Parent Company are accounted for using the s ame principle as described \\nin note 1 in the Groupâs consolidated /f_inancial stat ements. \\nThe share-based payments that the Parent Company ha s granted to employ -\\nees in subsidiaries are not accounted for as an emp loyee expense in the Parent \\nCompany, but are recognized against Shares in Group  companies. This vesting \\ncost is accrued over the same period as in the Grou p and with a corresponding \\nincrease in equity for equity-settled programs and as a change in liabilities for \\ncash-settled programs.Financial guarantees\\nFinancial guarantees issued by the Parent Company f or the bene/f_it of subsidiar -\\nies are not valued according to IFRS 9. They are re ported as contingent liabilities, \\nunless it becomes probable that the guarantees will  lead to payments. In such \\ncase, provisions will be recorded. \\nHedge accounting\\nInterest-bearing liabilities denominated in other c urrencies than SEK, used to \\nhedge currency exposure from investments in shares of foreign subsidiaries are \\nnot translated using the foreign exchange rates on the reporting date, but mea -\\nsured based on the exchange rate the day that the h edging relation was estab -\\nlished. \\nDerivatives used to hedge investments in shares in foreign subsidiaries are \\nrecognized at fair value and changes therein are re cognized in pro/f_it or loss. The \\ncorresponding fair value change on shares in subsid iaries is recognized in pro/f_it \\nor loss, as fair value hedge accounting is applied.\\nGroup and shareholdersâ contributions \\nIn Sweden, Group contributions are deductible for t ax purposes but sharehold -\\nersâ contributions are not. Group contributions are  recognized as appropria -\\ntions in the income statement. Shareholdersâ contri butions are recognized as an \\nincrease of Shares in Group companies and tested fo r impairment.114 Atlas Copco 2019FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PARENT COMPANY\\nA2.Employees and personnel expenses and \\nremunerations to auditors\\nAverage number of employees\\n2019 2018\\nWomen Men Total Women Men Total \\nSweden 61 41 102 62  37 99 \\n \\nWomen in Atlas Copco Board and Management, % Dec. 31, \\n2019Dec. 31, \\n2018\\nBoard of Directors excl. union representatives 33 33 \\nGroup Management 22 22 \\nSalaries and other remuneration\\n2019 2018\\nBoard members \\nand Group \\nManagement 1)Other \\nemployeesBoard members \\nand Group \\nManagement 1)Other \\nemployees\\nSweden 107 159 33 96 \\nof which variable \\ncompensation 18  16  \\n1)   Includes 8 (8) Board members who receive fees fr om Atlas Copco AB as well as the  \\nPresident and CEO and 6 (6) members of Group Manage ment who are employed by  \\nand receive salary and other remuneration from the Company.\\nFor information regarding remuneration and other fe es for members of the \\nBoard, the President and CEO, and other members of Group Management, see \\nnote 5 of the consolidated /f_inancial statements.\\nPension bene/f_its and other social costs 2019 2018\\nContractual pension bene/f_its for Board  members \\nand Group Management 10 10\\nContractual pension bene/f_its for other employees 21 20 \\nOther social costs 104 47 \\nTotal 135 77 \\nPension obligations to former members of  \\nGroup Management 4 5 \\nRemunerations to auditors\\nAudit fees and consultancy fees for advice or assis tance other than audit, were \\nas follows:\\n2019 2018\\nDeloitte   \\nâ audit fee 6 5 \\nâ audit activities other than audit assignment 1 2 \\nâ other services 4 10 \\nTotal 11 17 \\nAudit fee refers to audit of the /f_inancial statement s and the accounting records. \\nFor the Parent Company the audit also includes the administration of the busi -\\nness by the Board of Directors, the President and C EO.\\nAudit activities other than the audit assignment re fer for example to comfort \\nletters and the limited assurance report on Atlas C opcoâs sustainability report.\\nTax services include tax compliance services.\\nOther services essentially comprise consultancy ser vices, such as consultancy \\nservices related to the preparation of the split of  the Group.\\nAt the Annual General Meeting 2019, Deloitte was el ected as auditor for the \\nGroup up and including the Annual General Meeting 2 020.A3.

The annual accounts and \\nconsolidated accounts of the company are included o n pages 13â39, 44â48 and \\n51â125 in this document.\\nIn our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepa red in accordance with \\nthe Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the /f_inancial \\nposition of the parent company as of December 31, 2 019 and its /f_inancial perfor -\\nmance and cash /f_low for the year then ended in accor dance with the Annual \\nAccounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been p repared in accordance \\nwith the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in  all material respects, the \\n/f_inancial position of the group as of December 31, 2 019 and its /f_inancial perfor -\\nmance and cash /f_low for the year then ended in accor dance with International \\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by  the EU, and the Annual \\nAccounts Act. Our opinions do not cover the corpora te governance statement \\non pages 51â61. The statutory administration report  is consistent with the other \\nparts of the annual accounts and consolidated accou nts.\\nWe therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts \\nthe income statement and balance sheet for the pare nt company and the \\ngroup. \\nOur opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated \\naccounts are consistent with the content of the add itional report that has been \\nsubmitted to the parent companyâs audit committee i n accordance with the \\nAudit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Internati onal Standards on Audit -\\ning (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards  in Sweden. Our responsibil -\\nities under those standards are further described i n the Auditorâs Responsibili -\\nties section. We are independent of the parent comp any and the group in accor -\\ndance with professional ethics for accountants in S weden and have otherwise \\nful/f_illed our ethical responsibilities in accordance  with these requirements. This \\nincludes that, based on our best knowledge and beli ef, no prohibited services \\nreferred to in the Auditors Regulation (537/2014) A rticle 5.1 has been provided \\nto the audited company or, where applicable, its pa rent company or its con -\\ntrolled companies in the EU.\\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is su/uniFB03cient and appro -\\npriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\\nKey Audit Matters\\nKey audit matters of the audit are those matters th at, in our professional judg -\\nment, were of most signi/f_icance in our audit of the annual accounts and consoli -\\ndated accounts of the current period. These matters  were addressed in the con -\\ntext of our audit of, and in forming our opinion th ereon, the annual accounts \\nand consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not  provide a separate opinion \\non these matters.\\nRecognition of revenue in the appropriate period\\nThe group generates revenues from product and produ ct related o/uniFB00erings \\nranging from equipment, service and rental to custo mers in multiple geogra -\\nphies. The time of delivery of the di/uniFB00erent o/uniFB00ering s ranges from a speci/f_ic point \\nin time to over several years, and the sales agreem ents may include complex \\nterms such as buy-back commitments, return rights, and a single transaction \\nmay contain separate revenue components such as pro duct delivery, installa -\\ntion and servicing of equipment sold. All these com plexities managed by several \\nhundred subsidiaries require policies and procedure s as well as management \\njudgment to determine the appropriate method and pe riod to properly recog -\\nnize revenues.\\nIn note 1 the groupâs revenue recognition policy to gether with critical \\naccounting estimates and judgments is described, an d note 4 provides disclo -\\nsures of revenues separated on di/uniFB00erent product o/uniFB00e rings and geographies.To the annual general meeting of the shareholders o f Atlas Copco AB\\nCorporate identity number 556014-2720\\nOur audit procedures\\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited  to:\\nâ¢ assessing the groupâs accounting policy for reven ue recognition and its  \\ncompliance with IFRS,\\nâ¢ analytical review of revenues disaggregated on di /uniFB00erent product o/uniFB00erings \\nand geographies, and\\nâ¢ on a sample basis testing of sales transaction fo r revenue recognition in the \\nappropriate period.\\nValuation of trade receivables\\nThe group has signi/f_icant amounts of trade receivabl es from its sales to custom -\\ners in around 180 countries. There is a risk that p arts of the receivables will not \\nbe paid. The risk may be higher in some geographies  due to weaker economic \\nconditions or geopolitical uncertainties. Procedure s for collecting payments \\nand assessing customersâ ability to pay together wi th appropriate accounting \\npolicies to recognize provisions for doubtful recei vables are important factors to \\nensure a fair valuation of trade receivables.\\nIn note 1 the groupâs policy for recognizing impair ment of trade receivables is \\ndescribed, and note 17 describes the provisions for  bad debts and note 27 dis -\\nclose the ageing of trade receivables.\\nOur audit procedures\\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited  to:\\nâ¢ assessing the groupâs accounting policy for recog nizing bad debt for  \\ncompliance with IFRS,\\nâ¢ evaluating processes and controls for credit asse ssments and approval of \\ncredit limits,\\nâ¢ on a sample basis con/f_irming trade receivables aga inst customer statements \\nalternatively against cash receipts, and\\nâ¢ evaluating managementâs estimates of the provisio n for doubtful  \\nreceivables.\\nValuation of inventory\\nThe group carries signi/f_icant inventories of goods a nd spare parts produced and \\nheld by several production companies and customer c entres in many countries. \\nValuation of inventory requires clear policies and is subject to managementâs \\nestimates for determining its cost, judgment about its saleability and its net real -\\nizable value as well as procedures for safeguarding  and keeping track of the \\ninventory.\\nIn note 1 the groupâs inventory accounting policy a nd critical accounting esti -\\nmates and judgments are described, and note 16 prov ides disclosures of the \\ngroupâs inventory obsolescence provisions.\\nOur audit procedures\\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited  to:\\nâ¢ assessing the groupâs accounting policy and the i ndividual entitiesâ  \\naccounting for inventory in compliance with IFRS,\\nâ¢ observations of physical inventory counts,\\nâ¢ on a sample basis testing of the valuation of inv entory,\\nâ¢ evaluating managementâs estimates of the obsolesc ence reserve, and\\nâ¢ review of eliminations of intragroup pro/f_its in in ventory.\\nAccounting for Income taxes\\nAccounting for income taxes are subject to complex tax legislation requiring \\nmanagementâs interpretation and judgment. The interpretations made  by man -\\nagement may be challenged by di/uniFB00erent tax authoriti es, other authorities and \\ncourts. The groupâs geographical footprint also req uires adherence to tax legis -\\nlation and transfer pricing requirements in many di /uniFB00erent countries.\\nIn note 1 the groupâs accounting policy for income taxes together with critical \\naccounting estimates and judgments is described, an d note 9 provides disclo -\\nsures of income taxes.\\nOur audit procedures\\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited  to:\\nâ¢ review of tax calculations to assess if the incom e tax expense and tax assets \\nand liabilities have been appropriately accounted f or, and\\nâ¢ assessing managementâs processes for monitoring c ompliance with  \\nincome tax legislation and transfer pricing require ments in the di/uniFB00erent \\ngeographies.Atlas Copco 2019 127Audit report, continued\\nAccounting for business combinations and valuation of associated  \\ngoodwill and intangible assets\\nIn 2019 the group completed 18 acquisitions for a t otal consideration of 7 717 \\nMSEK. Accounting for business combinations requires signi/f_icant judgme nts \\nand estimates by management to identify and separat ely recognize acquired \\nassets and assumed liabilities, and to determine ac quisition date fair value of \\nacquired assets and assumed liabilities. Considerin g that there is often no active \\nmarket for these assets and liabilities, valuation models have to be applied to \\ndetermine their fair values requiring the application of signi/f_icant  judgment and \\nestimates by management.\\nIn note 1 the groupâs policy for accounting for acq uisitions Is described, and \\nnote 2 provides disclosures of acquisitions made.\\nOur audit procedures\\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited  to:\\nâ¢ review of purchase price allocations for signi/f_icant acquisitions ut ilizing  \\nvaluation specialists to review fair values assigne d to acquired assets and \\nassumed liabilities.\\nOther information than the annual accounts and cons olidated accounts\\nThis document also contains other information than the annual accounts and \\nconsolidated accounts and is found on pages 2â12, 4 0â43, 49â50 and 129â144. \\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director ar e responsible for this other \\ninformation.\\nOur opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated  accounts does not \\ncover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance  \\nconclusion regarding this other information.\\nIn connection with our audit of the annual accounts  and consolidated \\naccounts, our responsibility is to read the informa tion identi/f_ied above and  \\nconsider whether the information is materially inco nsistent with the annual \\naccounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedu re we also take into account \\nour knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and a ssess whether the infor -\\nmation is otherwise appears to be materially missta ted.\\nIf we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude \\nthat there is a material misstatement of this infor mation, we are required to \\nreport that fact. We have nothing to report in this  regards.\\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director ar e responsible for the prepa -\\nration of the annual accounts and consolidated acco unts and that they give a \\nfair presentation in accordance with the Annual Acc ounts Act and, concerning \\nthe consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The \\nBoard of Directors and the Managing Director are al so responsible for such \\ninternal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of \\nannual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material mis -\\nstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\nIn preparing the annual accounts and consolidated a ccounts, the Board of \\nDirectors and the Managing Director are responsible  for the assessment of the \\ncompanyâs and the groupâs ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, \\nas applicable, matters related to going concern and  using the going concern \\nbasis of accounting. The going concern basis of acc ounting is however not \\napplied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intend to liquidate \\nthe company, to cease operations, or have no realis tic alternative but to do so.  \\nThe audit committee shall, without prejudice to the  Board of Directorâs \\nresponsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the companyâs \\n/f_inancial reporting process.\\nAuditorâs responsibility\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance a bout whether the annual \\naccounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are f ree from material misstate -\\nment, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a n auditorâs report that \\nincludes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a hi gh level of assurance, but is \\nnot a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordan ce with ISAs and generally \\naccepted auditing standards in Sweden will always d etect a material misstate -\\nment when it exists. Misstatements can arise from f raud or error and are consid -\\nered material if, individually or in the aggregate,  they could reasonably be \\nexpected to in/f_luence the economic decisions of user s taken on the basis of \\nthese annual accounts and consolidated accounts.As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exe rcise professional judgment \\nand maintain professional scepticism throughout the  audit. We also:\\nâ¢ Identify and assess the risks of material misstat ement of the annual accounts \\nand consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and per -\\nform audit procedures responsive to those risks, an d obtain audit evidence \\nthat is su/uniFB03cient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinions. The risk \\nof not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than \\nfor one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten -\\ntional omissions, misrepresentations, or the overri de of internal control.\\nâ¢ Obtain an understanding of the companyâs internal  control relevant to our \\naudit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum -\\nstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an o pinion on the e/uniFB00ective -\\nness of the companyâs internal control.\\nâ¢ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting polici es used and the reason -\\nableness of accounting estimates and related disclo sures made by the Board \\nof Directors and the Managing Director.\\nâ¢ Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of D irectorsâ and the Manag -\\ning Directorâs use of the going concern basis of ac counting in preparing the \\nannual accounts and consolidated accounts. We also draw a conclusion, \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether  any material uncer -\\ntainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/f_icant doubt \\non the companyâs and the groupâs ability to continu e as a going concern. If \\nwe conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw \\nattention in our auditorâs report to the related di sclosures in the annual \\naccounts and consolidated accounts or, if such disc losures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion about the annual accounts and co nsolidated accounts. \\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obt ained up to the date of \\nour auditorâs report. However, future events or con ditions may cause a com -\\npany and a group to cease to continue as a going co ncern.\\nâ¢ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual \\naccounts and consolidated accounts, including the d isclosures, and whether \\nthe annual accounts and consolidated accounts repre sent the underlying \\ntransactions and events in a manner that achieves f air presentation.\\nâ¢ Obtain su/uniFB03cient and appropriate audit evidence re garding the /f_inancial \\ninformation of the entities or business activities within the group to express \\nan opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are res ponsible for the direc -\\ntion, supervision and performance of the group audi t.

The examination of the a dministration and the pro -\\nposed appropriations of the companyâs pro/f_it or loss  is based primarily on the \\naudit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our \\nprofessional judgment with starting point in risk a nd materiality. This means \\nthat we focus the examination on such actions, area s and relationships that are \\nmaterial for the operations and where deviations an d violations would have \\nparticular importance for the companyâs situation. We examine and test deci -\\nsions undertaken, support for decisions, actions ta ken and other circumstances \\nthat are relevant to our opinion concerning dischar ge from liability. As a basis for \\nour opinion on the Board of Directorsâ proposed app ropriations of the compa -\\nnyâs pro/f_it or loss we examined the Board of Directo rsâ reasoned statement and \\na selection of supporting evidence in order to be a ble to assess whether the pro -\\nposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.The auditorâs examination of the corporate governan ce statement\\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for that the corporate governance state -\\nment on pages 51â61 has been prepared in accordance  with the Annual \\nAccounts Act.\\nOur examination of the corporate governance stateme nt is conducted in \\naccordance with FARâs auditing standard RevU 16 The  auditorÂ´s examination of \\nthe corporate governance statement.

In 2019, operat ing costs including costs to \\nsuppliers for goods and services, functional costs deducted for employee wages \\nand bene/f_its amounted to MSEK 56 952 (52/uni00A0557). Emplo yee wages and bene/f_its \\nincreased to MSEK 25/uni00A0220 (22/uni00A0129). The Groupâs prov iders of capital, for example \\nshareholders and creditors, provide funds to /f_inance  the asset base that is used \\nto create economic value. In return, these stakehol ders receive annual dividend \\nand interest. The costs for providers of capital in  cluding dividend was MSEK \\n8/uni00A0149 (9/uni00A0381). \\nAtlas Copco contributes to economic development wit hin the regions where \\nit operates, through payments to pension funds and social security, and payments \\nof taxes, social costs and other duties. The cost f or direct taxes to governments \\nincreased 0.6% to MSEK 4 909 (4/uni00A0876). The Group has  been in dialogue with \\nstakeholders regarding disclosure of taxes by count ry (note 9). Community \\ninvestments amounted to MSEK 22. The economic value  retained amounted to \\nMSEK 9/uni00A0000 (7/uni00A0472).\\nLocal purchasing (non-core) is encouraged in order to generate societal value \\nin the communities where Atlas Copco operates, by c reating job opportunities as \\nwell as generating direct and indirect income. This  is mostly carried out by indi -\\nvidual companies, and also decreases the environmen tal impact from transport.\\nAnti-corruption and anti-competitive behavior\\nAtlas Copco has zero tolerance against corruption. The Business Code of Practice \\nis the Groupâs central policy document, accessible to all employees in the internal \\ndatabase. All employees are required to sign the co mpliance statement for \\nadherence to the Business Code of Practice, and tak e online trainings annually. \\nDivision presidents have the ultimate responsibilit y for adherence to the values \\nand policies of the Group. Internal control is exer cised through distribution of \\nresponsibility and internal audits. The compliance board oversees compliance \\nwith the Business Code of Practice.\\nGrievance mechanism\\nA new misconduct reporting system handled by a thir d-party organization, was \\nimplemented at the turn of the year 2019/2020 repla cing the previous system. \\nThe system o/uniFB00ers reporting oppurtunities in all Gro up languages and is accessi -\\nble 24/7. It can be used by employees or other stak eholders to report behavior \\nor actions that are, or may be perceived as, violat ions of laws or of the Business \\nCode of Practice.

In 13 cases there were no evidence \\nof wrongdoing, in 17 cases there were no wrongdoing , in 9 cases the investiga -\\ntion led to some form of consequence for the person  responsible for the wrong -\\ndoing. In 17 cases the internal process has been ch anged. 1 case was in court. \\nThere were no signi/f_icant /f_ines or non-monetary sanct ions for non-competi -\\ntive behavior or for non-compliance with laws and/o r regulations in the social \\nand economic area during the year.ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT \\nAtlas Copco has integrated the most material enviro nmental KPIs into its strategic \\nwork. The KPIs drive improvement and e/uniFB03ciency, whil e reducing the Groupâs \\nimpact on the environment. \\nEnvironmental performance is monitored and reported  on unit level and \\naggregated to Group level. General managers are res ponsible for overseeing \\nthe implementation of divisional strategies and goa ls, including undertaking \\ninitiatives to curb energy use and emissions as wel l as to increase the proportion \\nof renewable energy used.\\nEnvironmental management systems\\nTo help minimize the environmental impact and to se cure that the precautionary \\napproach is applied, Atlas Copco has the ambition t o implement environmental \\nmanagement systems in all operations. All product c ompanies should be certi -\\n/f_ied according to ISO 14001 in order to manage and r educe their environmental \\nimpact. Acquired product companies are normally cer ti/f_ied within a two-year \\nperiod. \\nAtlas Copco strives for all major operating units t o be triple-certi/f_ied accord -\\ning to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001/ISO 4500 1. All production units \\nwith more than ten employees and all customer compa nies and rental compa -\\nnies with more than 70 employees are to be triple-c erti/f_ied. By the end of 2019 \\nthe share of required units not being triple-certi/f_i ed constituted 7% of the total \\nnumber of operational units. The same measure for e ach individual certi/f_ication \\nis 4% for ISO 9001, 6% for ISO 14001 and 7% for OHS AS 18001/ISO 45001. \\nThese units are mainly acquisitions still within th e two-year timeframe to comply, \\nor newly restructured units. Some units not yet tri ple-certi/f_ied are in the process \\nof becoming so, and a smaller portion has lacked th e resources so far to commit \\nto a triple certi/f_ication.\\nAtlas Copco requires direct signi/f_icant suppliers to  have a precautionary \\napproach and to have an environmental management sy stem. As of 2019, there \\nis a Group KPI measuring this approach and the ambi tion is that a growing num -\\nber of signi/f_icant direct suppliers should have an a pproved environmental man -\\nagement system. The de/f_inition is an environmental m anagement system that \\nful/f_ills the ISO14001 requirements, which can be con /f_irmed by one of the two \\napproaches below: \\nâ   The supplier is third-party certi/f_ied according to ISO 14001 and holds  \\na valid certi/f_icate. \\nâ   The supplier has been audited on-site by Atlas Copco in the last /f_ive years \\nensuring that ISO 14001 requirements are met, even though the supplier  \\ndoes not hold certi/f_icate. \\nEnergy consumption within the organization\\nEnergy consumption*, % 2019\\nDirect energy, renewable 0\\nDirect energy, non-renewable 28\\nIndirect energy, renewable (incl. renewable of mix) 41\\nIndirect energy, non-renewable 31\\n*  The calculation of indirect energy, i.e. energy purchased externally by the company, includes \\nelectricity (95%) and district heating (5%) used at  the sites. Atlas Copco does not report \\ncooling or steam separately. The calculation of dir ect energy, i.e. energy generated by the \\ncompany for its own production or operation, compri ses all fuels used on the sites, including \\ndiesel, bio-fuel, gasoline, solar, geothermal, prop ane and natural gas. \\nEnvironmental compliance\\nAtlas Copco follows applicable environmental laws i n all countries where the \\nGroup operates. Incidents or /f_ines are reported for non-compliance with envi -\\nronmental legislation, as well as incidents involvi ng chemical, oil or fuel spillages. \\nThere were 0 (1) accident(s) resulting in adverse e nvironmental e/uniFB00ects and there \\nwere no monetary sanctions for non-compliance accor ding to reporting.\\nTwo Swedish companies require permits based on Swed ish environmental \\nregulations. These operations mostly involve machin ing and assembly of com -\\nponents. The permits relate to areas such as emissi ons to water and air, as well as \\nnoise pollution. The Group has been granted 1 permi t needed to conduct its \\nbusiness and 1 was under revision in 2019. Atlas Copco 2019 133SUSTAINABILITY NOTES\\nOccupational health and safety\\nSafety and well-being are key priority areas for At las Copco, and all divisions set \\ntargets and make action plans to enhance awareness and improve behavior, \\npolicies and processes. Group companies shall have an Atlas Copco veri/f_ied \\nSafety Health Environment and Quality management sy stem, which is docu -\\nmented, implemented and maintained on an ongoing ba sis. Customer compa -\\nnies and rental companies with more than 70 employe es and all product com -\\npanies shall be certi/f_ied according to OHSAS 18001/I SO 45001. Continuous \\ne/uniFB00orts are put on behavioral based health and safet y. Safety days have been \\narranged in the Group since 2014.\\nThe safety pyramid\\nIn 2019, the Group started using the safety pyramid  for reporting to support \\nawareness and encourage safe behavior to decrease r isks and ultimately pre -\\nvent injuries in the workforce. Using the pyramid s upports transparent report -\\ning, risk averse behavior and behavior change. The de/f_initions of di/uniFB00erent sever -\\nity of incidents and injuries were changed to align  with international standards. \\nIt is therefore not possible to compare the number and rate of incidents and \\ninjuries with previous years.\\nThe Group KPI for safety-related measures is to hav e a balanced safety pyra -\\nmid. This means that more near misses than minor in juries, and more minor inju -\\nries than recordable injuries are reported. \\nThe results of the 2019 reporting in the safety pyr amid model is described in \\nthe table and in the illustration below. Major haza rds reported for high-conse -\\nquence injuries were road travel, slips and trips, lone working and manual han -\\ndling. Common injuries were for instance cuts from operating machines and \\nsprains from slipping. Actions undertaken to mitiga te hazards were among oth -\\ners defensive driving training, awareness training and risk assessment of working \\nenvironment, inspections, mechanical handling aids and ensuring safe access to \\nequipment. \\nThere was 1 (0) work-related fatality in the Group in 2019. It occurred when \\nan employee in South America was involved in a road  accident on a business trip.\\nHuman rights assessment\\nAtlas Copcoâs central guiding policy is the Busines s Code of Practice. Atlas Copco \\nis also a signatory of the UN Global Compact and is  committed to working with \\nthe ten universally accepted principles in the area s of human rights, labor, envi -\\nronment and anti-corruption. The Business Code of P ractice also supports the \\nInternational Labour Organization Declaration on Fu ndamental Principles and \\nRights at Work, as well as the OECDâs Guidelines fo r Multinational Enterprises. \\nThe Group committed to the UN Guiding Principles fo r Business and Human \\nRights when it was launched in 2011 and works to de velop the implementation \\nof the principles. In accordance with the framework âs requirements, Atlas Copco \\nhas an ongoing process to identify, prevent, mitiga te and account for the \\nhuman rights impacts related to Atlas Copcoâs busin ess and business relations. \\nThe Group strives to work according to the UN Guidi ng Principles across the \\nvalue chain, covering procurement, human resources,  sales, marketing and \\nother business processes. The Groupâs commitment co vers all individuals and \\ngroups who may be impacted by its activities or thr ough its business relation -\\nships. Human rights are monitored by the compliance  board, which has two \\nmembers of Group Management: the SVP general counse l and the SVP Commu -\\nnications and Governmental A/uniFB00airs.

The Group reports th e number of employees  \\nas full time equivalents (FTE) per geographical spr ead and per professional  \\ncategory, as well as divided between white-collar a nd blue-collar employees.  \\n \\nNew employee hires and employee turnover\\nThe total number and rate of external new employee hires in 2019 was 5/uni00A0003  \\n(5/uni00A0506) which constitutes 13.2% (15.3) of the total  average number of employ -\\nees during the year. The percentage of externally r ecruited females was 25% (23). \\nThe total number of resignations was 2 214 (2 380),  which constitutes 5.9% (6.6) \\nof the total average number of employees during the  year.\\nThe Groupâs KPIs for employee satisfaction and enga gement measure \\nemployeesâ perceived opportunities to grow in the c ompany and their percep -\\ntion of the company culture. The goal for both KPIs  are to be above the global \\nbenchmark. The benchmark re/f_lects the employee engag ement survey provid -\\nerâs proprietary benchmark for global companies. Th e benchmark incorporates \\nboth anonymized data from the survey providerâs glo bal customer base with \\ntens of millions of responses across more than 150 countries, as well as data from \\nindustry panel studies to produce robust and unbias ed normative data.\\nFreedom of association and collective bargaining\\nAtlas Copco views trade unions and employee represe ntatives as a necessary \\nand valuable support system for its employees, and fosters relationships based \\non mutual respect and constructive dialogue. As a v oluntary member of the UN \\nGlobal Compact, Atlas Copco ensures that labor prac tices such as the right to \\ncollective bargaining are included in the Business Code of Practice. In 2019, 34% \\n(34) of all employees were covered by collective ba rgaining agreements. \\nAs a decentralized organization, the engagement and  dialogue with labor \\nunions takes place at a local level. In countries w here no independent labor \\nunion exist, Atlas Copco has taken measures to esta blish forums for employer/\\nemployee relations, for example in China, through e nvironment and safety com -\\nmittees. A non-discrimination guideline covers all employees and the Business \\nCode of Practice also covers employee rights.\\nLabor relations are followed-up regularly on the op erational level and \\nreviewed by internal audit. Suppliers in the risk s cope are audited according to \\ncompliance to Atlas Copcoâs Business Code of Practi ce based on international \\nguidelines and frameworks such as the UN Global Com pact and the International \\nLabour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Prin ciples and Rights at Work. \\nDiversity and equal opportunity\\nAtlas Copcoâs global diversity policy states that e qual opportunity should apply \\nwhether Atlas Copco has the role of employer, suppl ier, business partner or cus -\\ntomer. Atlas Copco companies establish local divers ity policies and guidelines in \\nalignment with the Group policy, local laws and reg ulations, and local ambitions. \\nIn 2019, Atlas Copco established the Diversity and Inclusion Council chaired by \\nPresident and CEO Mats RahmstrÃ¶m. The council consi sts of representatives from \\nall business areas, along with the corporate commun ications, human resources \\nand accounting and controlling functions. The counc il meets regularly to follow \\nup on action plans and results in the operations. \\nThe Group strives to increase the share of women in  the organization, and has \\nestablished a KPI measuring the progress. The goal is that by 2030, there should \\nbe 30% women in the Group. Anti-harassment and non- discrimination are \\naddressed in the Business Code of Practice training  that all employees take yearly.\\nAtlas Copco has managers on international assignmen ts coming from 46 \\ncountries and working in 45. In 2019, a total of 72 % (70%) of all senior managers \\nwere locally employed. 44 nationalities are represe nted among the 450 most \\nsenior managers worldwide. The share of Swedish managers on inter national \\nassignments has decreased from 23% in 2001 to 5% in  2019.134 Atlas Copco 2019SUSTAINABILITY NOTES\\ndeemed relevant for speci/f_ic markets, for instance w hen Atlas Copco enters a \\nmarket that is perceived as presenting severe human  rights risks.\\nThe Atlas Copco misconduct reporting system can be used to report perceived \\nhuman rights violations.

Atlas Copco \\nbelieves in good corporate practice in the area of tax management, balancing \\nthe interests of various stakeholders, including cu stomers, investors as well as \\nthe governments and communities in the countries in  which the Group operates. \\nAtlas Copco does not engage in aggressive tax plann ing, but instead takes care \\nto pay the correct taxes in its countries of operat ion. Atlas Copcoâs tax policy can \\nbe found at the corporate website. See note 9 of th e consolidated /f_inancial \\nstatements for the details of taxes paid, reported according to the international \\n/f_inancial reporting standards.\\nDisclosing tax by country\\nAtlas Copco has been in dialogue with investors, NG Os and peers regarding dis -\\nclosure of tax paid per country. At present, there is no established international \\nstandard for reporting taxes paid by country and th e resulting data is therefore \\nnot comparable between di/uniFB00erent companies. Atlas Co pco is not opposed to \\nreporting tax paid by country if guidelines are bro adened to apply to all compa -\\nnies in the industry so that the data is comparable  and can be analyzed fairly.\\nResponsibility throughout the value chain\\nWorking with business partners who share the Groupâ s high standards regard -\\ning quality, business ethics, the environment and r esource e/uniFB03ciency is necessary \\nto e/uniFB00ectively manage risks, and to enhance producti vity in the value chain.

Atlas Copco  can provide experience and \\nknow-how to suppliers who need support in order to comply with the minimum \\nstandards set forth in the business partner complia nce document. However, \\nsuppliers who fail to meet the criteria and do not show a willingness to improve \\nare rejected.

Suppliers are rejected if they do not meet \\nAtlas Copco requirements and are not willing to improve. The Group does not keep black \\nlists of business partners. In 2019, one business partner was rejected due to \\nenvironmental, health & safety issues, no business partner was rejected due to corruption \\nin 2019. \\nDe/f_inition of signi/f_icant supplier\\nAtlas Copcoâs de/f_inition of signi/f_icant suppliers are  all external suppliers of \\ngoods and services, direct and indirect, with a pur chasing value above a set \\nthreshold, based on 12-month values from October pr evious year to September \\ncurrent year. For suppliers in countries with a hei ghtened risk for human rights \\nviolations, environmental risks or corruption etc.,  the purchasing threshold is \\nlower (approximately 13% of set value). In 2019, th e number of signi/f_icant sup -\\npliers increased compared with 2018 partly due to i ncrease in business and a \\nreview of the risk country list. \\nResponsible sourcing of con/f_lict minerals \\nResponsible sourcing of minerals is essential to At las Copco and though the \\nGroup does not procure directly from smelters, some  parts of the supply chain \\ndo. To ensure responsible sourcing of minerals, Atl as Copco has a comprehensive \\nprogram to investigate the possible use of con/f_lict minerals included in compo -\\nnents used in Atlas Copco products. \\nAtlas Copco is not in the scope of Dodd-Frank Act, but based on concerns of \\nviolations of human rights, and to support our cust omersâ obligation to the Act, \\nthe Group has measures to detect and prevent the us e of con/f_lict minerals in its \\nsupply chain. In accordance with the upcoming EU co n/f_lict mineral rule EU \\n2017/821 (due to enter into force in January, 2021) , Atlas Copco undertakes due \\ndiligence to ensure its supply chains are not contr ibuting to armed con/f_lict and \\ninstability in the Democratic Republic of Congo and  surrounding countries. \\nAs a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), Atlas Copco \\nadheres to its guidelines by encouraging suppliers to source from smelters veri/f_ied \\nby a third party such as RMIâs Responsible Minerals  Assurance Process, commits \\nto transparency by submitting reporting templates t o customers about smelters \\nin the supply chain and collaborates with stakehold ers. Atlas Copco 2019 135SUSTAINABILITY NOTES\\nEvaluation of distributors\\nAtlas Copco has a large international distributor b ase. Around 20% of revenues \\nare generated via distributors and agents. Atlas Co pcoâs sales strategies are set \\nby the divisions on a global level and are tuned fo r local market needs by the cus -\\ntomer centers. These sales strategies include the c hoice of sales channels and \\ndistributor management. The marketing councils ensu re cross-divisional align -\\nment and develop central policies and tools that im pact all operations. \\nStarting in 2019, the percentage of signi/f_icant dist ributors that sign the Atlas \\nCopco business criteria is a Group KPI covering all  signi/f_icant distributors for the \\nGroup. In 2019, 59% of all signi/f_icant distributors signed the business partner cri -\\nteria (74% of the signi/f_icant distributors were aske d to sign the criteria, and 80% \\nof them did so). Continued e/uniFB00orts will be made to i ncrease this share. \\nDe/f_inition of signi/f_icant distributors: Atlas Copcoâs de/f_inition of signi/f_icant \\ndistributors are all external distributors, includi ng agents and resellers with \\nsales of the Groupâs goods and services for a value  above a set threshold, based \\non 12-month values from October previous year to Se ptember current year. For \\ndistributors, agents and resellers in countries wit h a heightened risk for human \\nrights violations, environmental risks or corruption et c., the sales threshold is set \\nto include all active distributors.\\nProduct responsibility\\nAtlas Copco follows laws and regulations regarding safety, health and environ -\\nmental aspects, product information and labeling. A ll products shall, at a mini -\\nmum, be compliant with laws and regulations regardi ng their environmental \\nimpact and are tested for safety prior to delivery.  Further, all Atlas Copco  products and services come with relevant product, s ervice and safety informa -\\ntion. The information required by the Groupâs proce dures for product and service \\ninformation and labeling covers aspects such as sou rcing of components, content \\nsuch as substances of concern, safe use and disposa l of the product. Customer \\ntraining is included when relevant, to secure safe handling of the products. \\nIn general, all electrically driven Atlas Copco pro ducts sold into the EU fall \\nunder the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipm ent (WEEE) Directive. This \\nincludes compressors, vacuum pumps, handheld electr ic tools and monitoring \\ncontrol instruments. Atlas Copco is responsible for , and arranges with our custom -\\ners, the disposal of products that fall under the d irective. \\nAtlas Copco maintains lists of substances which are  either prohibited or must \\nbe declared due to their potential negative impact on health or the environ -\\nment. Prohibited substances are not allowed in the Groupâs products or pro -\\ncesses. Declarable substances should be limited in use, additionally any use of \\nsuch substances in items must be declared. Atlas Co pco informs suppliers on \\nregulatory updates and if prohibited substances sho uld be found, they must \\nimmediately be replaced with appropriate alternativ es. The lists are continu -\\nously revised according to applicable legislations,  this includes REACH and U.S. \\nState of California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic E nforcement Act of 1986 \\n(Proposition 65). The lists on prohibited and decla rable substances are also  \\npublished on the Atlas Copco website. \\nIncidents of non-compliance \\nNo cases have been /f_iled in 2019 (0) for non-complia nce with such laws and \\nregulations concerning the provision and use of suc h products and services.\\nThe energy e/uniFB03ciency calculations for the products \\ndetailed in the report are based on estimates provi ded \\nby Atlas Copcoâs research and development depart -\\nments. Carbon dioxide emissions factors used for th e \\ncalculations come from open source calculators or s tan-\\ndards. The calculation of the number of cars driven  for \\none year, corresponding to the carbon emission savi ngs \\nby the products, was made using the US Environmenta l \\nProtection Agencyâs Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies \\nCalculator. \\nOil-free compressor \\nPer power variant, the power consumption and e/uniFB03 -\\nciency of the old and new generation ZR Variable Sp eed \\nDrive machines at four identical points in the turn down \\nrange is weighed according to a widely accepted com -\\npressor load distribution. These numbers are then c on-\\nsolidated over the di/uniFB00erent power variants accordin g to \\nthe /f_irst year sales numbers, leading to the energy and \\nCO2 savings for the whole ZR VSD+ range.  Vacuum pump\\nThe measurement criteria for this exercise is the t otal \\nenergy and CO2 reduction resulting from the use of the \\nnew product where the saving is achieved by using \\nfewer pumps per chamber for the same performance. \\nThe number of new pumps sold each year since the \\nlaunch is used to calculate the total cumulative ru n \\nhours of the new product in the /f_ield, and hence the  \\nenergy saved compared to continuing to use the old \\nproducts for the application.\\n \\nElectric portable compressor\\nThe CO2 savings is obtained by calculating the emissions \\nfrom a diesel-driven XATS138 and subtracting the ca l-\\nculated emissions from an electricity-driven H250VS D \\nwhich replaces it for the same average usage: 750 h ours \\nper year and an air consumption at 75% of the maxi -\\nmum. One XATS138 consumes 6.7 m/uni00B3 of diesel this way , \\ntranslating to 18 metric tonnes of CO2 in one year. In \\ncomparison, one H250VSD compressor consumes \\n23/uni00A0065 kWh of electricity under the same conditions .  Multiplying by the average European CO2 intensity for \\npower electricity generation (0.46 kg CO2/kWh, see \\nhttps://www.eumayors.eu/IMG/pdf/technical_\\nannex_en.pdf) gives 10.6 metric tonnes of CO2 per year. \\nEnergy savings are calculated based on the H250VSD \\nenergy consumption in relation to a corresponding  \\nreference consumption for the previous diesel model .\\nBattery drill \\nThe comparison was made by measuring the electricit y \\nrequired to fully charge a battery and drill holes in alu -\\nminum till it is fully discharged. The amount of co m-\\npressed air needed to drill the same number of hole s \\nwith a pneumatic tool have been calculated and con -\\nverted in electric energy to drive a compressor. Th is \\nresulted in about 48.7 mWh per drilled hole with th e \\nbattery technology and about 704 mWh per drilled \\nhole with the pneumatic technology. The result \\nshowed that EBB26 requires about 93% less energy pe r \\ndrilled hole in this case.Calculations of product energy e/uniFB03ciency on pages 22 â33136 Atlas Copco 2019SUSTAINABILITY NOTES\\nAtlas Copco has prepared its sustainability report in accordance with the \\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines since 2001.

COS when p resented in relation to \\nsustainability information refers to cost of sales at standard cost in MSEK.\\n4)  Costs for providers of capital include /f_inancial c osts and dividend, but exclude \\nredemption of shares and repurchase of own shares. \\n5)  The total energy includes both indirect and direc t energy used. The calculation \\nof indirect energy, i.e. energy purchased externall y by the company, includes \\nelectricity (95%) and district heating (5%) used at  the sites. Atlas Copco does not \\nreport cooling or steam separately. The calculation  of direct energy, i.e. energy \\ngenerated by the company for its own production or operation, comprises all \\nfuels used on the sites, including diesel, biofuel,  gasoline, solar, geothermal, \\npropane and natural gas. 6)  The reporting of greenhouse gas emissions is done  in accordance with the GHG \\nProtocol (ghgprotocol.org). Country factors used fo r energy come from the \\nInternational Energy Agency. Indirect energy (Scope  2) is presented both as \\nmarket-based and location-based according to the GH G Protocol. Where \\nnothing else is stated a market-based approach has been applied. Factors from \\nNTM (transportmeasures.org) are used for transport of goods when emission \\ndata is not provided by the transport company. Scop e 3 emissions include \\ninbound and outbound transport of goods that the co mpany is responsible for \\nas de/f_ined by Incoterm. Out of scope emissions data for direct CO2 emissions \\nfrom biologically sequestered carbon (e.g. CO2 from burning biomass/biofuels) \\nwas 255 tonnes in 2019.\\n7)  Results are, as a rule, collected every two years  through the Groupâs employee \\nsurvey âInsightâ .

The Company has de/f_ined th e scope of the Sustain-\\nability Report on page 136 and the Statutory Sustai nability Report on page 19. \\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors and the  \\nExecutive Management\\nThe Board of Directors and the Executive Management  are responsible for the \\npreparation of the Sustainability Report including the Statutory Sustainability \\nReport in accordance with the applicable criteria a nd the Annual Accounts Act \\nrespectively. The criteria are de/f_ined on page 136 i n the Sustainability Report, \\nand are part of the Sustainability Reporting Guidel ines published by GRI (Global \\nReporting Initiative), which are applicable to the Sustainability Report, as well as \\nthe accounting and calculation principles that the Company has developed. This \\nresponsibility also includes the internal control r elevant to the preparation of a \\nSustainability Report that is free from material mi sstatements, whether due to \\nfraud or error.    \\nResponsibilities of the auditor \\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on th e Sustainability Report based \\non the limited assurance procedures we have perform ed and to express an \\nopinion regarding the Statutory Sustainability Repo rt. Our engagement is \\nlimited to historical information presented and doe s therefore not cover future-\\noriented information.\\nWe conducted our limited assurance engagement in ac cordance with  \\nISAE 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits o r Reviews of Historical \\nFinancial Information. A limited assurance engageme nt consists of making \\ninquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the  preparation of the Sustainabil -\\nity Report, and applying analytical and other limit ed assurance procedures. Our \\nexamination regarding the Statutory Sustainability Report has been conducted in accordance with FARâs accounting standard RevR 1 2 The auditorâs opinion \\nregarding the Statutory Sustainability Report. A li mited assurance engagement \\nand an examination according to RevR 12 is di/uniFB00erent  and substantially less in \\nscope than an audit conducted in accordance with In ternational Standards on \\nAuditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.\\nThe /f_irm applies ISQC 1 (International Standard on Q uality Control) and \\naccordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control in cluding \\ndocumented policies and procedures regarding compli ance with ethical \\nrequirements, professional standards and applicable  legal and regulatory \\nrequirements. We are independent of Atlas Copco AB in accordance with \\nprofessional ethics for accountants in Sweden and h ave otherwise ful/f_illed our \\nethical responsibilities in accordance with these r equirements.\\nThe limited assurance procedures performed and the examination according \\nto RevR 12 do not enable us to obtain assurance tha t we would become aware \\nof all signi/f_icant matters that might be identi/f_ied i n an audit. The conclusion \\nbased on a limited assurance engagement and an exam ination according to \\nRevR 12 does not provide the same level of assuranc e as a conclusion based on \\nan audit.\\nOur procedures are based on the criteria de/f_ined by the Board of Directors \\nand the Executive Management as described above. We  consider these criteria \\nsuitable for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.\\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is su /uniFB03cient and appropriate \\nto provide a basis for our conclusion below.\\nConclusion\\nBased on the limited assurance procedures we have p erformed, nothing has \\ncome to our attention that causes us to believe tha t the Sustainability Report,  \\nis not prepared, in all material respects, in accor dance with the criteria de/f_ined \\nby the Board of Directors and Executive Management.   \\nA Statutory Sustainability Report has been prepared .\\n Lennart Nordqvist\\nExpert Member of FARThomas StrÃ¶mberg\\nAuthorized Public AccountantAuditorâs Limited Assurance Report on Atlas Copco A Bâs \\nSustainability Report and statement regarding the  \\nStatutory Sustainability Report 142 Atlas Copco 2019Goal performanceGOAL PERFORMANCE\\n*      Figures for the years between 2010 and 2017 are best estimated numbers, as the e/uniFB00ects of the \\ndistribution of Epiroc and restatements for IFRS 15  are not fully reconciled.\\n* *  For more information about the sustainability focus areas, targets and processes, please see page s \\n34â43 and the sustainability notes on pages 130â140 .FINANCIAL GOALS\\nRevenue growth measured over a business cycle.

changed during 2019we invest more in rd than our competitorsand during 2019 we accelerated our innovation power further our aim is to shorten thetime from idea to innovation we are alwayslooking to improve our current productrange but we are also looking at projectsthat are close to our current products andtechnologies has significant market potential and that accelerate our innovationpower that is why we are now dedicatingmore resources to projects that are not moreof the same but instead aim to go above andbeyond for us innovation is about understandinghow we can bring value to our customers aproduct can have the coolest features but ifit doesnt make the customers products andprocesses cheaper safer more precise or lessenergy consuming then it is just anotherproductnot an innovation page 35 what value does digitalization bringdigitalization brings value to our customersin almost every aspect of their operationsmost evidently our products are essentialwhen it comes to enabling the storing andprocessing of data and needed to producesensors flat screens and other equipmentthat are part of our everyday lifebut digitalization brings value on deeperlevels as well our connected products collect customers data and we add valuethrough our experience analytic abilitiesand improved service ounifb00ering digitized production lines will enable us to measure andmonitor our customers equipment and toplan and foresee maintenance by seeingwhich parts actually need to be replaced andwhen this is of high importance to our customers as our products are key to their production process and failures often come at ahigh cost digitalization makes it possible to sell increased productivity and uptime as aproduct instead of first selling a product andthen adding an optional service programthis way we can go towards predictive orprescriptive service programs based on thedata collected instead of fixing somethingalready broken the benefits for the customer are many not least maximum uptimeand optimal productivity and we sawgrowth in service in all business areas during2019digitalization also brings value if we canleverage it to create a better customer experience by making it easier to access information about our products as well as buyingthem and tracking deliveries onlinewith increased focus on sustainability and climate change what role can atlas copco play for decades atlas copco has made important technological advances to improve our products energy eunifb03ciency thereby for us innovation is about understanding how we canbring value

It was also a year when we welcomed mo re new companies  \\ninto the Group through acquisitions than any year b efore. \\nMats RahmstrÃ¶m, President and CEO of \\nthe Atlas Copco Group, 2019 was a year \\nwith record-high revenues and orders \\nreceived, what are your comments on  \\nthe results?\\nThis past y ear was another one with very \\nstrong results. The operating pro/f_it reached \\nMSEK 21/uni00A0897, orders received increased 9 \\npercent to MSEK 106 104, and revenues \\nincreased to MSEK 103 756. I am proud of our \\nstrong teams that have worked to /f_ind even \\nbetter ways to support our customers.  \\n       PAGE 7\\nDuring 2019 the global economy has been \\na/uniFB00ected by increased uncertainties. How \\nis Atlas Copco handling this situation? \\nI believe that our global presence, decentral-\\nized operations and closeness to our custom-\\ners give us the ability to not only adapt to this \\nsomewhat new business climate but to also \\nbene/f_it from it. \\nI believe that our global presence, \\ndecentralized operations and \\ncloseness to our customers give \\nus the ability to not only adapt  \\nto this somewhat new business \\nclimate but to also bene/f_it from it.Atlas Copco has a long history of \\nacquiring companies and in 2019 a record \\nnumber of companies joined the Group. \\nWhat are the criteria when looking at \\npossible acquisitions? \\nOur divisions are responsible for mapping \\nand evaluating businesses that are adjacent \\nto our core businesses and that o/uniFB00er syner-\\ngies. Acquisitions have brought important \\ncontributions in the past and we will con-\\ntinue to complement our organic growth in \\nthis way. To achieve our goal to grow 8 per-\\ncent annually over a business cycle, which is \\nsigni/f_icantly above the global GDP, we need \\nto acquire companies in the right segments. \\nThrough acquisitions we bring in new tech-\\nnologies, service opportunities and people \\nwith new ideas that we can combine with \\nour existing strengths. I am very pleased to \\nwelcome new members into the Group since \\nit brings both opportunities and diversity.  Our business model ensures resilience and \\n/f_lexibility in both good and tougher times. \\nThis past year we have seen increasing \\nunpredictability, a changing business climate \\nand less willingness to invest in some seg-\\nments. We have experienced increased com-\\nplexity due to Brexit and trade wars. Our \\nstrategy and business model have proven \\ne/uniFB00ective despite this and I believe that our \\nresults not only for 2019 but long-term con-\\n/f_irm this.  \\nWe plan and prepare for the future. In \\nareas where there are uncertainties we pre-\\npare for di/uniFB00erent scenarios and how they \\nmight a/uniFB00ect us instead of speculating about \\nwhat the future might bring. We create long-\\nterm growth and value for our customers by \\nkeeping manufacturing and R&D close to \\nthem and with one third of our revenues in \\nEurope, one third in the Americas and one \\nthird in Asia we are a truly global industrial \\ngroup.         PAGE 14Atlas Copco 2019 3PRESIDENT AND CEO\\nWhat about resources devoted to R&D, \\nhas that changed during 2019? \\nWe invest more in R&D than our competitors \\nand during 2019 we accelerated our innova -\\ntion power further. Our aim is to shorten the \\ntime from idea to innovation. We are always \\nlooking to improve our current product \\nrange but we are also looking at projects \\nthat are close to our current products and \\ntechnologies, has signi/f_icant market poten -\\ntial and that accelerate our innovation \\npower. That is why we are now dedicating \\nmore resources to projects that are not more \\nof the same but instead aim to go above and \\nbeyond.\\nFor us innovation is about understanding \\nhow we can bring value to our customers. A \\nproduct can have the coolest features, but if \\nit doesnât make the customerâs products and \\nprocesses cheaper, safer, more precise or less \\nenergy consuming, then it is just another \\nproduct â not an innovation. \\n       PAGE 35\\nWhat value does digitalization bring? \\nDigitalization brings value to our customers \\nin almost every aspect of their operations. \\nMost evidently, our products are essential \\nwhen it comes to enabling the storing and \\nprocessing of data, and needed to produce \\nsensors, /f_lat screens and other equipment \\nthat are part of our everyday life. \\nBut digitalization brings value on deeper \\nlevels as well. Our connected products col -\\nlect customersâ data and we add value \\nthrough our experience, analytic abilities \\nand improved service o/uniFB00ering. Digitized pro -\\nduction lines will enable us to measure and \\nmonitor our customersâ equipment, and to \\nplan and foresee maintenance by seeing \\nwhich parts actually need to be replaced and \\nwhen. This is of high importance to our cus -\\ntomers as our products are key to their pro -\\nduction process and failures often come at a \\nhigh cost. Digitalization makes it possible to sell increased productivity and uptime as a \\nproduct instead of /f_irst selling a product and \\nthen adding an optional service program. \\nThis way we can go towards predictive or \\nprescriptive service programs based on the \\ndata collected, instead of /f_ixing something \\nalready broken. The bene/f_its for the cus -\\ntomer are many, not least maximum uptime \\nand optimal productivity, and we saw \\ngrowth in service in all business areas during \\n2019. \\nDigitalization also brings value if we can \\nleverage it to create a better customer expe -\\nrience by making it easier to access informa -\\ntion about our products as well as buying \\nthem and tracking deliveries online. \\nWith increased focus on sustainability  \\nand climate change, what role can  \\nAtlas Copco play?\\nFor decades, Atlas Copco has made import -\\nant technological advances to improve  \\nour productsâ energy e/uniFB03ciency, thereby For us innovation is about understanding how we can  bring value to our  \\ncustomers. A product can have the coolest features,  but if it doesnât make \\nthe customerâs products and processes cheaper, safe r, more precise or less \\nenergy consuming, then it is just another product â  not an innovation. \\nreducing costs and emissions. This is our core  \\ncompetence and mandate. It remains the \\nmost impactful way we can reduce carbon \\nemissions and contribute to our customersâ \\nand our own sustainability ambitions. One \\nprominent example is the VSD+ technology \\nused in compressors, generators and vacuum \\npumps, which o/uniFB00ers our customers notable \\nenergy savings. Another example is Atlas \\nCopco abatement systems that remove \\ngreenhouse gases in the semiconductor \\nindustry. \\nIt is said by many that 2020 is the start of \\nthe âdecade for actionâ for achieving the  \\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set \\nby the United Nations, and I agree. Our goals \\nfor sustainability, launched in early 2019 with \\n2018 as the base line, set the direction for \\nAtlas Copco being part of the solutions for \\nmany years to come. They help ensure that \\nwe create value for all stakeholders and that \\nis the right way to grow our company.   \\n      PAGE 42\\nCustomer collaboration day at  \\nIndustrial Technique in Japan4 Atlas Copco 2019PRESIDENT AND CEO\\nAtlas Copco has de/f_ined goals in six focus \\nareas: pro/f_itability, people, ethics, \\nproduct and services, environment, and \\nsafety and well-being. Why is that? \\nThe goals support our mission of achieving \\nsustainable pro/f_itable growth and by setting \\ngoals in these areas we create lasting value \\nfor our customers, our employees and the \\nplanet. They also support the SDGs and we \\nwant to be part in /f_inding solutions for the \\nchallenges we are facing.\\nI am con/f_ident that our organization will \\n/f_ind ways to meet even the most ambitious \\nof our goals. In our decentralized organiza -\\ntion we have a culture with strong focus on \\nperformance and every level has the respon -\\nsibility for setting targets that help us reach \\nthe goals, and every level has accountability \\nfor results. \\nTo create opportunities for all our employ -\\nees to learn and grow we strive to create a \\nwork culture of respect, fairness and open -\\nness. When I meet with colleagues all over \\nthe world I am impressed by how our com -\\npany culture and teams in many ways tran -\\nscend borders. We allow mobility and \\nencourage development and willingness  \\nto change. Diversity is key to attract and keep talent as \\nwell as to boost innovation. We also ensure \\nthat our employees understand the aspects \\nof ethics most relevant to their roles, and \\nhelp prepare them to avoid or to handle  \\nethically challenging situations. \\nWhen it comes to reducing carbon diox -\\nide, we take increased responsibility for the \\nenvironmental impact of our products by \\nstrengthening our focus on the footprint \\nthroughout their entire life-cycle. In every -\\nthing we do we strive to contribute to a bet -\\nter future and bring value to our customers, \\nemployees and shareholders.        PAGE 42\\nWhat are the results this far? \\nThe goal for reducing carbon dioxide from \\noperations and transport has already had \\nconsiderable impact in the organization \\nsince its launch in early 2019. We have seen \\nsigni/f_icant investment and action across the \\norganization to increase the share of renew -\\nable electricity and solar energy, improved \\nforecasting to reduce air freight, and product \\ntesting using biodiesel. These measures have \\nreduced carbon dioxide emissions from our \\nown operations and transport of goods. We \\nchallenge ourselves and our partners to \\nbring down emissions from transport, and \\nthere is an opportunity to improve even  \\nfurther in this area.When I meet with colleagues all over the world I am  impressed by how \\nour company culture and teams in many ways transcen d borders. We \\nallow mobility and encourage development and willin gness to change. \\nWhat would you say is the key to future \\nsuccess? \\nOur ability to constantly challenge and  \\ninnovate. At Atlas Copco, we innovate with \\nthe customer in focus and the future in mind.  \\nWe continuously improve our processes, \\nproducts and services. We monitor our  \\nprogress, strategies and targets and reassess \\nthem when necessary.

Customer engagement, sales and ser -\\nvice take place through direct and indirect \\nchannels (mainly distributors), online as well \\nas o/uniFB04ine, to maximize market presence. The \\nGroup has a global reach with sales in more \\nthan 180 countries. \\nSales of equipment is performed by engi -\\nneers with strong application knowledge \\nand the ambition to o/uniFB00er the best solution \\nfor the customerâs speci/f_ic application.

Innovation and \\nproduct development are very important \\nand products are designed internally. \\nA key activity is to design new or improved \\nproducts that provide sustainable and  \\ntangible bene/f_its in terms of productivity, \\nenergy e/uniFB03ciency and/or lower life-cycle cost \\nfor the customer, and at the same time can \\nbe e/uniFB03ciently produced. Atlas Copco protects \\ntechnical innovations with patents. \\nInnovation also includes better processes \\nto improve the /f_low and utilization of assets \\nand information. Innovation will improve \\ncustomer satisfaction and contribute to \\nstrengthening customer relations, the  \\nbrand, as well as /f_inancial performance. \\nOvercapacities and ine/uniFB03ciencies must \\nalways be challenged. \\nInvestments in /f_ixed assets and \\nworking capital\\nThe need for investments in property, plant \\nand equipment are moderate due to the \\nmanufacturing philosophy and can be \\nadapted in the short and medium term to \\nchanges in demand. Most investments are \\nrelated to machining equipment for core \\nmanufacturing activities and to production \\nfacilities, primarily for core component  \\nmanufacturing and assembly operations. \\nThe working capital requirements of the \\nGroup are a/uniFB00ected by the relative high share \\nof sales through own customer centers, \\nwhich a/uniFB00ects the amount of inventory and receivables. In an improving business climate \\nwith higher volumes, more working capital \\nwill be tied up. If the business climate deteri -\\norates, working capital will be released.\\nAcquisitions\\nAcquisitions are primarily made in, or very \\nclose to, already existing core businesses. All \\ndivisions are required to map and evaluate \\nbusinesses that are adjacent and can o/uniFB00er \\ntangible synergies with existing businesses. \\nAll acquired businesses are expected to make \\na positive contribution to economic value \\nadded.\\nLeadership and human capital\\nIn Atlas Copco, leadership is de/f_ined as the \\nability to create lasting results. Atlas Copco \\nbelieves that competent and committed \\nleaders are crucial to achieving sustainable \\npro/f_itable growth and has developed a lead -\\nership model. All managers are entitled to a mission statement from their manager, \\nwhich outlines the long-term expectations \\nand goals and is described in both quantita -\\ntive and qualitative measures. Typically a mis -\\nsion has a timeframe of three to /f_ive years. \\nBased on the mission statement, the man -\\nager is expected to develop a vision, which \\nclari/f_ies how the mission will be achieved, as \\nwell as the strategies, the organization and \\nthe people needed to make it happen.\\nAtlas Copco strives to be a good employer \\nto attract and develop quali/f_ied and moti -\\nvated people.

The organic growth was 3%, m ore favorable \\nexchange rates contributed with 5%, and acquisition s added 1%. \\nThe service business, including specialty rental, c ontinued to grow, \\nwith increased order volumes in all business areas.  In total, the order \\nintake for service increased about 6% organically, while orders for \\nequipment increased by approximately 1% organically .\\nOrder volumes increased for compressors, mainly sup ported by \\nincreased demand for large industrial, and gas and process compressors, \\nparticularly in Asia. Orders for small and medium-s ized industrial  \\ncompressors were essentially unchanged.\\nThe demand for vacuum equipment to the semiconducto r industry \\nremained at about the same high level as in the pre vious year, sup-\\nported primarily by increased demand in China, and investments in \\nnew production technologies in other regions. Order  volumes for vacuum \\nequipment to the industrial and scienti/f_ic markets w ere negatively \\na/uniFB00ected by weakened demand in Asia and Europe.\\nThe order intake for advanced industrial tools and assembly solu -\\ntions decreased, mainly due to weakened demand from  the motor \\nvehicle industry in the latter half of the year, pa rticularly in Asia and \\nNorth America. \\nOrder volumes increased for portable air and power and /f_low prod -\\nucts, such as portable compressors, construction to ols, generators and \\npumps, supported by demand from equipment rental co mpanies in \\nthe /f_irst half of the year.

However, the order intake f or industrial tools \\nand assembly solutions decreased, due to weakened d emand from the \\nmotor vehicle industry. The service business increa sed in all business \\nareas except Industrial Technique. North America ac counted for 25% \\n(24) of orders received.\\nSouth America\\nOrders received in South America increased 12% in l ocal currencies. \\nThe growth was supported by improved demand for com pressors and \\npower equipment, while the demand for industrial to ols and assembly \\nsolutions decreased. Solid growth was achieved for the service business. \\nIn total, South America accounted for 4% (4) of ord ers received.\\n Europe\\nOrders received in Europe increased 3% in local cur rencies. Order  \\nvolumes for equipment remained at about the same le vel as the previ -\\nous year. The order intake increased for most types  of compressors \\nand power equipment, but decreased for vacuum equip ment, and \\nindustrial tools and assembly solutions. Order volu mes for the service \\nbusiness increased in all business areas. In total,  Europe accounted for \\n30% (31) of orders received.  \\nAfrica/Middle East\\nOrders received increased 4% in Africa/Middle East in local currencies. \\nThe order intake for larger industrial compressors as well as gas and \\nprocess compressors increased, while volumes for po rtable compressors \\ndeclined. The order intake for industrial tools and  assembly solutions \\nalso increased, as well as for service, supported b y strong demand for \\nspecialty rental solutions. In total, Africa/Middle  East accounted for \\n6% (6) of orders received.\\nAsia/Oceania\\nOrder intake in local currencies in Asia/Oceania in creased by 4%. Order \\nvolumes increased for equipment, and solid growth w as achieved for \\nservice.

Such risks are mainly assessed and \\naddressed within the risk-management sys -\\ntem at divisional level, see page 46. Among \\nthe risks are also increased energy prices and \\ntaxes, and regulations related to CO2 emis -\\nsions. Atlas Copcoâs continuous work to \\nincrease the energy e/uniFB03ciency of its products \\nhelps mitigate such risks and represents a \\npotential market opportunity. \\nChanging weather patterns may pose a \\nphysical risk to operational units or suppliers \\nin areas in risk of raising sea levels, water scar -\\ncity or violent storms. Market shifts toward a \\nlow-carbon economy may impact the viabil -\\nity of certain sectors and give rise to new \\nbusinesses and business models to be served \\nby Atlas Copco. For instance, increased gen -\\neration of renewable energy, such as solar \\npanels and wind mills, and the surge in pro -\\nduction of electrical vehicles present business \\nopportunities to provide products and ser -\\nvices to these industries.\\nIncreased use of renewable energy\\nThe ambition to reduce negative climate \\nimpact spurs the increased use of renewable \\nenergy in the Groupâs operations. Diversify -\\ning sources of energy to include renewable \\nenergy has a positive environmental impact \\nand protects the business from price /f_luctua -\\ntions and the lack of traditional energy \\nsources. \\nIn some markets, renewable energy  \\nmay not be readily available or is a minor \\ncomponent in the countryâs energy mix.  This composes a challenge to Atlas Copcoâs \\nability to meet its target to reduce CO2 emis -\\nsions from energy in operations. The energy \\nmix supplied also in/f_luences the impact from \\nthe use-phase of products, and thereby Atlas \\nCopcoâs value-chain footprint. E/uniFB00orts are \\nmade to increase the percentage of renew -\\nable energy used in operations. In 2019, the \\npercentage of renewable energy of total \\nenergy used in operations increased to 41% \\n(34). \\nImpact from operations and \\ntransportation of goods\\nAtlas Copcoâs ambition is to reduce the CO2 \\nemissions from energy in operations and \\ntransport of goods by half in relation to cost \\nof sales by 2030. To achieve this, a wide range \\nof actions is undertaken. Buying renewable \\nelectricity from the grid, installing solar pan -\\nels, switching to bio-fuels in tests of compres -\\nsors, and implementing energy-conservation \\nmeasures are some examples. Regarding CO2 \\nfrom transportation of goods, collaboration \\nwith freight forwarders and a restrictive use \\nof airfreight are examples of actions under -\\ntaken and planned. However, the nature of \\nthe business makes avoiding airfreight com -\\nplicated. Collaboration with transport part -\\nners, and to some extent technical develop -\\nments, are key enablers to achieve Atlas  \\nCopcoâs ambitious goal in this area. \\nIn 2019, Atlas Copco decreased the CO2 \\nemissions from energy in operations and \\ntransport of goods in relation to cost of sales \\nby 19%.

The main drivers \\nfor the reduction were purchasing of renew -\\nable electricity, reduced use of airfreight and \\nimproved supply-chain e/uniFB03ciency. \\nReducing waste from operations\\nTo reduce the volume of waste is an impor -\\ntant way to decrease the total environmental \\nimpact from production and move towards \\nincreasing circularity. Atlas Copco has suc -\\ncessfully increased the amount of reused, \\nrecycled and recovered waste, and the level \\nhas been at a consistent and high level for \\nseveral years. Therefore, focus is on decreas -\\ning the total volume of waste. As of 2019, the \\ntotal volume of waste in relation to cost of \\nsales is a Group KPI. In 2019, it decreased by \\n10% compared to 2018, mainly because of \\nre-classi/f_ication of reporting entities.\\nWater management \\nWater is an increasingly scarce resource in \\nmany parts of the world and access to clean \\nwater is key for a sustainable development. \\nAtlas Copcoâs overall water consumption is \\nrelatively low due to the Groupâs focus on \\nassembly rather than other resource-intensive \\nactivities. Nevertheless, Atlas Copco seeks to \\ndecrease its usage of water and to increase \\nwater reuse and circulation. Innovative  product design and improved processes also \\nreduce water use for customers. \\nAtlas Copco has established a KPI measur -\\ning consolidated water consumption in rela -\\ntion to cost of sales. The consumption of \\nwater decreased by 17% in 2019 in relation \\nto cost of sales. Water consumption in abso -\\nlute numbers decreased by 10%, mainly due \\nto improved water management and water \\ncirculation. \\nEnvironmental risks in the supply chain\\nAtlas Copco recognizes the responsibility to \\nmanage environmental risks in its value chain, \\nsee sustainability notes, page 134. Atlas \\nCopco works with tier-one suppliers using its \\nbusiness partner criteria and action plans \\ndeveloped together with business partners. \\nSmelters and other resource-intensive activi -\\nties are often tier-two suppliers, or further \\ndown the value chain. \\nCommitment to the business partner crite -\\nria means that suppliers take responsibility to \\nminimize the environmental impact of prod -\\nucts and services during manufacturing, dis -\\ntribution and usage, as well as after disposal. \\nScreening and audits are part of the Groupâs \\nsupplier management system. \\nTo further increase the Groupâs e/uniFB00orts to \\nreduce its impact along the value chain, a new \\nKPI was established in 2019.

Well-manage d risks can lead to opportunities and add \\nvalue to the business while risks that are not well -managed can lead to incidents and losses.  \\nAtlas Copcoâs global and diversi/f_ied business towards many customer \\nsegments results in a variety of risks and opportunities geographically \\nand operationally. Thus, the ability to identify, analyze and manage \\nrisks is crucial for e/uniFB00ective governance and control of the business. \\nThe aim is to achieve Group goals with a high risk awareness and well-\\nmanaged risk taking, in line with the strategy and within the frame of \\nthe companyâs manual âThe Way We Do Thingsâ. Atlas Copco sees the \\nbene/f_its of an e/uniFB03cient risk management both from risk reduction and \\nbusiness opportunity perspectives, which can lead to good business \\ngrowth.\\nThe Groupâs risk management approach follows the decentralized \\nstructure of Atlas Copco. Local companies are responsible for their own \\nrisk management, which is monitored and followed up regularly e.g. at \\nlocal business board meetings. Group functions for legal, insurance, \\nsustainability, treasury, tax, controlling and accounting provide policies, \\nguidelines and instructions regarding risk management. This is regu-\\nlarly audited by internal and external audits. Examples of risks and how \\nthey are handled in Atlas Copco are shown in the table in this section.\\nInsurance\\nThe Group Insurance Program is provided by the in-house insurance \\ncompany Industria Insurance Company Ltd. which retains part of the \\nrisk exposure for the following insurance lines; property damage, \\nbusiness interruption, transport, and general and product liability. \\nFinancial lines insurance and business travel insurance are managed \\nby the Groupâs Insurance and Risk Management department. How-\\never, Industria is not the insurer for these two lines. Insurance capacity \\nis purchased from leading insurers and reinsurers by way of using \\ninternational insurance brokers. Claims management services are \\npartly purchased on a global basis from leading providers. Insurance \\npolicies are issued on a local basis to ensure compliance with local \\ninsurance laws where required.  \\nLoss prevention\\nThe main purpose of Atlas Copcoâs loss prevention process is to  \\nprevent potential property losses and business interruptions. Atlas \\nCopcoâs Loss Prevention Standard stipulates Group requirements in \\nregards of loss prevention for product companies and distribution \\ncenters, including areas like: construction, safety systems, loss preven-\\ntion procedures and plans that need to be prepared. To ensure align-\\nment with the standard and to support sitesâ understanding of how \\nthe standard applies to each site, around 25 risk surveys are per-\\nformed annually. The results from the risk surveys are consolidated \\nand reported to Group Management.ATLAS COPCO\\nEnterprise Risk \\nManagement \\nprocessMonitor and \\nre-evaluateRisk  \\nidenti/f_ication\\nRisk  \\nmanagementRisk \\nevaluationRisk \\nanalysis\\nRisk process\\nIn Atlas Copco, Enterprise Risk Management is not seen as a project but  \\nas a continuous process.

The de/f_ined framework is described in the picture above.Enterprise risk management\\nAtlas Copco has developed an enterprise risk management process to \\nmap strategic risks. The methodology used is applied on divisions, \\nwhich is the highest operational level in the Group. Annual work-\\nshops are held by each divisional management team where risks are \\nidenti/f_ied, analyzed, evaluated/re-evaluated and managed to ensure \\na structured and proactive approach to risks exposing Atlas Copco. \\nThe ownership of managing the risks raised in this process lies within \\neach division, while the Insurance and Risk Management department \\nmanages the overall process, moderates the sessions and consoli-\\ndates the results on Group level.

Experience from \\nmanufacturing industry with international \\ncoverage is important, as it is Atlas Copcoâs \\nmain focus. The Nomination Committeeâs \\ndiversity policy is based on section 4.1 in the \\nCorporate Governance Code. The nine Board \\nmembers elected by the shareholders have \\nbackgrounds from various industries. Three \\nof the eight non-executive members are \\nwomen. Three are born in the 1960âs, three in \\nthe 1950âs, two in the 1940âs, and one person \\nis born in the 1970âs. The Board members are \\nof three di /uniFB00erent nationalities from Germany \\nand the United States, with a majority of the \\nBoard members coming from Sweden. \\nIncreasing the diversity of the Board of Direc-\\ntors with regards to gender is a priority for \\nthe Nomination Committee.Based on the /f_indings of the Chair of the \\nBoard, the Nomination Committee annually \\nevaluates the work of the Board. Further to \\nthat, the Nomination Committee proposes \\nthe Chair to the Annual General Meeting, \\nprepares a proposal regarding number and \\nnames of Board members, including Chair \\nand a proposal for remuneration to the Chair \\nand other Board members not employed by \\nthe Company, as well as a proposal for remu-\\nneration for Board committee work. Finally, \\nthe Nomination Committee proposes an \\naudit company including remuneration for \\nthe audit. \\nThe proposals and the Nomination  \\nCommitteeâs statement will be published at \\nthe latest with the notice to the AGM 2020.  \\nIn the Nomination Committeeâs strive to \\nreach gender balance, for example in case  \\nof equal competence, the candidate that will \\nlead to improved gender balance should be \\nproposed. \\nIn compliance with the Swedish Corporate \\nGovernance Code and the procedures \\nadopted by the AGM 2016, the representa-tives of the four largest shareholders, listed \\nin the shareholdersâ register as of August 31, \\n2019, together with the Chair of the Board \\nshall form the Nomination Committee.

The Board is responsible for follow-\\ning applicable rules and implementing e/uniFB03-\\ncient control systems in the decentralized \\norganization. An e/uniFB03cient control system \\no/uniFB00ers the correct balance between risk and \\ncontrol. The long-term growth incentive is \\nregularly evaluated by the Board based on \\nthe Groupâs /f_inancial situation and /f_inancial, \\nlegal, social and environmental risk. The  \\nmission is to achieve a sustainable and  \\npro/f_itable development of the Group.\\nBoard of Directorsâ members\\nThe Board of Directors consists of nine \\nelected members, including the President \\nand CEO. The Board also has two union \\nmembers, each with one personal deputy. \\nAtlas Copco ful/f_illed the 2019 requirements \\nof Nasdaq Stockholm and the rules of the  \\nSwedish Corporate Governance Code \\nregarding independency of board members. \\nThe Board of Directorsâ work\\nThe Board continuously addresses the strate-\\ngic direction, the /f_inancial performance, and \\nthe methods to maintain sustainable pro/f_it-\\nability of the Group. Further, the Board regu-\\nlarly ensures that e/uniFB03cient control systems \\nare in place. The Board also follows up on the \\ncompliance of the Business Code of Practice as well as the whistleblowing system. Besides \\nthe general distribution of responsibilities \\nthat apply, in accordance with the Swedish \\nCompanies Act and the Code, the Board and \\nits committees (Audit Committee, Remuner-\\nation Committee and others) annually \\nreview and adopt âThe Rules of Procedureâ \\nand âThe Written Instructionsâ, which are \\ndocuments that govern the Boardâs work and \\ndistribution of tasks between the Board, the \\ncommittees and the President as well as the \\nCompanyâs reporting processes.\\nThe Board held eight meetings in 2019. Five \\nmeetings were held at Atlas Copco AB in \\nNacka, Sweden, one per capsulam, one per \\ntelephone and one meeting in Antwerp dur-\\ning the study trip in the fall. The attendance at \\nBoard meetings is presented on page 56â57.\\nThe Board continuously evaluates the  \\nperformance of the President and CEO, Mats \\nRahmstrÃ¶m. For the Annual Audit, the com-\\npanyâs principal auditor, Thomas StrÃ¶mberg, \\nDeloitte, reported his observations and the \\nBoard also had a separate session with the \\nauditor where members of Group Manage-\\nment were not present. \\nEvaluation of the Board of Directorsâ work \\nThe annual evaluation of the Board of  \\nDirectorsâ work, including the Boardâs com-\\nmittees (Audit Committee, Remuneration \\nCommittee and others) was conducted by \\nthe Chair of the Board, Hans StrÃ¥berg. He \\nevaluated the Boardâs working procedures, \\ncompetence and composition, including the \\nbackground, experience and diversity of Board members. His /f_indings were presented \\nto the Nomination Committee. \\nRemuneration to the Board of Directors \\nRemuneration and fees are based on the \\nwork performed by the Board. The AGM \\n2019 decided to adopt the Nomination  \\nCommitteeâs proposal for remuneration to \\nthe Chair and other Board members not \\nemployed by the Company, and the pro-\\nposed remuneration for committee work. \\nSee also note 5.\\nâ¢ The Chair was granted an amount of  \\nSEK 2 325 000.\\nâ¢ Each of the other Board members not  \\nemployed by the company were granted  \\nSEK 740 000.\\nâ¢ An amount of SEK 315 000 was granted  \\nto the Chair of the Audit Committee and  \\nSEK 200/uni00A0000 to each of the other mem-\\nbers of this committee.\\nâ¢ An amount of SEK 125/uni00A0000 was granted  \\nto the Chair of the Remuneration  \\nCommittee and SEK 90 000 to each of the \\nother members of this committee was \\ngranted.\\nâ¢ An amount of SEK 100/uni00A0000 was granted  \\nto each non-executive director who, in  \\naddition, participates in committee work \\ndecided upon by the Board.\\nâ¢ The meeting further resolved that 50%  \\nof the directorâs Board fee could be  \\nreceived in the form of synthetic shares.54 Atlas Copco 2019THE YEAR IN REVIEW â CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\\n5. Audit Committee\\nThe Audit Committee is selected by the \\nBoard at the statutory Board meeting after \\nthe Annual General Meeting and until the \\nstatutory Board meeting the following year. \\nThe work of the Audit Committee is directed \\nby the Audit Committee Charter, which is \\nreviewed and approved annually by the \\nBoard. The Chair of the committee has the \\naccounting competence required by the \\nSwedish Companies Act and two of the \\nmembers are independent from the Com-\\npany and its main shareholder. The Audit \\nCommitteeâs primary task is to support the \\nBoard of Directors in ful/f_illing its responsibili-\\nties in the areas of audit and internal control, \\naccounting, /f_inancial reporting and risk man-\\nagement as well as to supervise the /f_inancial \\nstructure and operations of the Group and \\napprove /f_inancial guarantees and new legal \\nentities, delegated by the Board. The Audit \\nCommittee work further includes reviewing \\ninternal audit procedures, monitoring the \\nexternal auditor, considering any inspection \\n/f_indings, review and monitor the indepen-\\ndence of the external auditor, and assist the \\nNomination Committee in the selection of \\nthe auditor.\\nDuring the year, the committee convened \\n/f_ive times. All members were present at these \\nmeetings. All meetings of the Audit Commit-\\ntee have been reported to the Board of Direc-\\ntors and the corresponding Minutes have \\nbeen distributed to the Board.  \\nThe Audit Committee during 2019 was  \\nSta/uniFB00an Bohman, Chair, Gunilla Berg, Johan \\nForssell and Hans StrÃ¥berg.\\nAtlas Copco is registered in Sweden and is legally governed by the \\nSwedish Companies Act (2005:551). This act requires that the \\nBoard of Directors governs the Company to be pro/f_itable and cre-\\nate value for its shareholders. However, Atlas Copco recognizes \\ngoing beyond this, extending it to integrating sustainability into \\nits business creates long-term value for all stakeholders, which is \\nultimately in the best interest of the Company, the shareholders \\nand society. The signi/f_icant stakeholder audience, as outlined in \\nthe Atlas Copco Business Code of Practice, includes representa-\\ntives of society, em ployees, customers, business partners and \\nshareholders.\\nThe Business Code of Practice is the central guiding policy for \\nAtlas Copco, and is owned by the Board of Directors. Its commit-\\nment goes beyond the requirements of legal compliance, to sup-\\nport voluntary international ethical guidelines. These include the \\nUnited Nations International Bill of Human Rights, International \\nLabour Organizationâs Declaration on Fundamental Principles \\nand Rights at Work, the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and OECDâs Guidelines for Multinational Enter-\\nprises. Atlas Copco has employed a stakeholder-driven approach \\nin order to identify the most material environmental, human \\nrights, labor and ethical aspects of its business. These priorities \\nguide how the Group develops and drives its business strategy, as \\nwell as its roadmap to support the UN Sustainable Development \\nGoals. \\nThe strategic pillars together with the Group goals presen ted \\non pages 5 and 11 all aim at continuously delivering sustainable, \\npro/f_itable growth for the Group. This means an increased eco-\\nnomic value creation and, simultaneously, a positive impact on \\nsociety and the environment, thus creating shared value. \\nAtlas Copco monitors and voluntarily discloses the progress on \\nthese material /f_inancial and non-/f_inancial aspects, through an \\nexternally assured, integrated annual report. In addition to the \\nAnnual General Meeting, Atlas Copco also creates engagement \\nopportunities so that non-shareholders can address the Group in \\nvarious stakeholder dialogues.Statement of materiality and signi/f_icant audiences 6. Remuneration Committee\\nThe Remuneration Committeeâs primary task \\nis to propose to the Board the remuneration \\nto the President and CEO and a long-term \\nincentive plan for key employees. The goal \\nwith a long-term incentive plan is to align the \\ninterests of key personnel with those of the \\nshareholders. The Remuneration Policy for \\nGroup Management aims to establish princi-\\nples for a fair and consistent remuneration \\nwith respect to compensation, bene/f_its, and \\ntermination. The base salary is determined \\nby position and performance and the vari-\\nable compensation is for the achievement of \\nindividual goals. The Remuneration Policy is \\nreviewed annually and the AGM 2019 \\napproved the guidelines for remuneration. \\nSee also note 5. \\nThe Remuneration Committee had three \\nmeetings in 2019. All members were present. \\nDuring the year, the Remuneration Commit-\\ntee also supported the President and CEO in \\ndetermining remuneration to the other \\nmembers of Group Management. All meet-\\nings of the Remuneration Committee have \\nbeen reported to the Board and the corre-\\nsponding Minutes have been distributed to \\nthe Board.\\nThe Remuneration Committee during \\n2019 was Hans StrÃ¥berg, Chair, Peter  \\nWallenberg Jr and Anders Ullberg.7. Auditor\\nThe task of the external auditor is to examine \\nAtlas Copcoâs annual accounts and account-\\ning practices, as well as to review the Board \\nand the CEOâs management of the Company. \\nAt the AGM 2019 the audit /f_irm Deloitte AB, \\nSweden, was elected external auditor until \\nthe AGM 2020 in compliance with a proposal \\nfrom the Nomination Committee. The princi-\\npal auditor is Thomas StrÃ¶mberg, Authorized \\nPublic Accountant at Deloitte AB.\\nAt the AGM 2019, Thomas StrÃ¶mberg \\nreferred to the auditorâs report for the Com-\\npany and the Group in the annual report and \\nexplained the process applied when per-\\nforming the audit. He also recommended \\nadoption of the presented income state-\\nments and balance sheets, discharge of  \\nliability for the President and CEO and the \\nBoard of Directors, and adoption of the  \\nproposed distribution of pro/f_its. \\n8. Internal Audit and Assurance\\nInternal Audit and Assurance aims to provide \\nindependent and objective assurance on \\ninternal control by conducting internal \\naudits. It reports /f_ive times per year to the \\nAudit Committee. Read more on pages \\n60â61.Atlas Copco 2019 55THE YEAR IN REVIEW â CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\\n9. Group Management\\nBesides the President and CEO, the Group \\nManagement consists of four business area \\npresidents and four senior vice presidents \\nresponsible for the main Group functions; \\nCorporate Communications and Govern-\\nmental A/uniFB00airs, Human Resources, Control-\\nling and Finance, and Legal. The President \\nand CEO is responsible for the ongoing man-\\nagement of the Group following the Boardâs \\nguidelines and instructions. \\nRemuneration to Group Management \\nThe Remuneration Policy is reviewed and \\npresented to the AGM by the Board of Direc-\\ntors for approval every year. In 2019, the AGM \\ndecided to adopt the Boardâs proposal. The remuneration covers an annual base  \\nsalary, variable compensation, possible long-\\nterm incentive (personnel options), pension \\npremium and other bene/f_its. The variable \\ncompensation is limited to a maximum per-\\ncentage of the base salary. Variable compen-\\nsation is dependent upon how certain quan-\\ntitative and qualitative goals set in advance \\nare achieved. These goals are based on /f_inan-\\ncial and non-/f_inancial parameters and vary \\nbetween di/uniFB00erent positions. Non-/f_inancial \\nparameters have for example been in rela-\\ntion to the Business Code of Practice. No fees \\nare paid for Board memberships in Group \\ncompanies or for other duties performed. 56 Atlas Copco 2019THE YEAR IN REVIEW â CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\\nBoard of Directors\\nName\\nPosition\\nBornHans StrÃ¥berg\\nChair since 2014\\n1957Mats RahmstrÃ¶m\\nBoard member\\nPresident and CEO\\n1965Gunilla Berg\\nBoard member\\n1960Sta/uniFB00an Bohman\\nBoard member\\n1949Tina Donikowski\\nBoard member\\n1959\\nEducation M.Sc. in Mechanical  \\nEngineering, Chalmers  \\nUniversity of Technology,  \\nGothenburg.MBA from the Henley  \\nManagement College,  \\nthe United Kingdom.B.Sc. in Economics and  \\nBusiness Administration, \\nStockholm School of  \\nEconomics.B.Sc. in Economics and  \\nBusiness Administration, \\nStockholm School of  \\nEconomics and Stanford  \\nExecutive Program, U.S.B.Sc. in Industrial  \\nManagement from  \\nGannon University, U.S.\\nNationality / Elected Swedish / 2013 Swedish / 2017 Swedish / 2016 Swedish / 2003 American / 2017\\nExternal memberships Chair of SKF, Roxtec AB, \\nCTEK AB, Vice Chair of Stora \\nEnso Oyj, Finland.

PRINCIPLES\\nThe consolidated /f_inancial statements comprise Atlas  Copco AB, the Parent \\nCompany (âthe Companyâ), and its subsidiaries (toge ther âthe Groupâ or Atlas \\nCopco) and the Groupâs interest in associated compa nies and joint ventures. \\nAtlas Copco AB is headquartered in Nacka, Sweden.\\nBasis of preparation\\nThe consolidated /f_inancial statements have been prep ared in accordance with \\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the EU. The \\nstatements are also prepared in accordance with the  Swedish recommendation \\nRFR 1 âSupplementary Accounting Rules for Groupsâ a nd applicable statements \\nissued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. Th ese require certain addi -\\ntional disclosures for Swedish consolidated /f_inancia l statements prepared in \\naccordance with IFRS.\\nThe accounting principles set out below have been c onsistently applied to all \\nperiods presented, unless otherwise stated, and for  all entities included in the \\nconsolidated /f_inancial statements. The annual report  for the Group and for Atlas \\nCopco AB, including /f_inancial statements, was approv ed for issuance on Febru -\\nary 28, 2020. The balance sheets and income stateme nts are subject to approval \\nby the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders o n April 23, 2020.\\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe consolidated /f_inancial statements have been prep ared in accordance with \\nthe acquisition method. Accordingly, business combi nations are seen as if the \\nGroup directly acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities of the entity \\nacquired. The consolidated income statements and ba lance sheets of the Group \\ninclude all entities in which the Company, directly  or indirectly, has control. \\nControl exists when the Company has power over the entity, is exposed, or \\nhas rights, to variable returns from its involvemen t with the entity and has the \\nability to use its power to a/uniFB00ect its returns. Gene rally, control and hence consoli -\\ndation is based on ownership. In a few exceptions, consolidation is based on \\nagreements that give the Group control over an enti ty. See note A22 for infor -\\nmation on the Groupâs subsidiaries.  \\nIntra-group balances and internal income and expens e arising from intra-\\ngroup transactions are fully eliminated in preparin g the consolidated /f_inancial \\nstatements. Gains and losses arising from intra-gro up transactions that are rec -\\nognized in assets, such as inventory and /f_ixed asset s, are eliminated in full, but \\nlosses only to the extent that there is no evidence  of impairment.\\nBusiness combinations\\nAt the acquisition date, i.e. the date on which con trol is obtained, each identi/f_i -\\nable asset acquired and liability assumed is recogn ized at its acquisition-date \\nfair value. The consideration transferred, measured at fair value, in cludes assets \\ntransferred by the Group, liabilities to the former  owners of the acquiree and the \\nequity interests issued by the Group in exchange fo r control of the acquiree. Any \\nsubsequent change in such fair value is recognized in pro/f_it or loss, unless the \\ncontingent consideration is classi/f_ied as equity. Transactions costs  that the \\nGroup incur in connection with a business combinati on are expensed as \\nincurred.\\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of th e consideration trans -\\nferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests  in the acquiree, and the fair \\nvalue of the Groupâs previously held equity interes t in the acquiree (if any) over \\nthe net of acquisition-date fair value amounts of t he identi/f_iable assets acquired \\nand liabilities assumed. \\nNon-controlling interest is initially measured eith er \\nâ¢ at fair value, or \\nâ¢ at the non-controlling interestâs proportionate s hare of the fair value of  \\nidenti/f_iable net assets. \\nSubsequent pro/f_it or loss attributable to the non-co ntrolling interest is allo -\\ncated to the non-controlling interest, even if it p uts the non-controlling interest \\nin a de/f_icit position. Acquisitions of non-controlli ng interests are recognized as a \\ntransaction between equity attributable to owners o f the parent and non-con -\\ntrolling interests. The di/uniFB00erence between considera tion paid and the propor -\\ntionate share of net assets acquired is recognized in equity. For details on the \\nacquisitions made during the year, see note 2.\\nAssociated companies and joint ventures\\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has si gni/f_icant in/f_luence, but not \\ncontrol, over /f_inancial and operating policies. When  the Group holds 20â50% of \\nthe voting power, it is presumed that signi/f_icant in /f_luence exists, unless other -\\nwise demonstrated. A joint venture is an entity ove r which the Group has joint \\ncontrol, through contractual agreements with one or  more parties. Investments \\nin associated companies and joint ventures are repo rted according to the equity \\nmethod. This means that the carrying value of inter ests in an associate or joint \\nventure corresponds to the Groupâs share of reporte d equity of the associate or 1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements\\njoint venture, plus any goodwill, and any other rem aining fair value adjustments \\nrecognized at acquisition date. \\nâShares of pro/f_it in associated companies and joint venturesâ, included in the \\nincome statements, comprises the Groupâs share of t he associateâs and joint \\nventureâs income after tax adjusted for any amortiz ation and depreciation, \\nimpairment losses, and other adjustments arising fr om any remaining fair value \\nadjustments recognized at acquisition date. Dividen ds received from an associ -\\nated company or joint venture reduce the carrying v alue of the investment.\\nUnrealized gains and losses arising from transactio ns with an associate or a \\njoint venture are eliminated to the extent of the G roupâs interest, but losses only \\nto the extent that there is no evidence of impairme nt of the asset. When the \\nGroupâs share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its \\ninterest in the associate or joint venture, the Gro up does not recognize further \\nlosses unless the Group has incurred obligations or  made payments on behalf of \\nthe associate.\\nFunctional currency and foreign currency translatio n \\nThe consolidated /f_inancial statements are presented in Swedish krona (SEK), \\nwhich is the functional currency for Atlas Copco AB  and also the presentation \\ncurrency for the Groupâs /f_inancial reporting. Unless  otherwise stated, the \\namounts presented are in millions Swedish krona (MS EK).\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated a t the foreign exchange rate \\nruling at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary  items carried at historical \\ncost are reported using the exchange rate at the da te of the transaction and \\nnon-monetary items carried at fair value are report ed at the rate that existed \\nwhen the fair values were determined. Tangible and intangible assets, inventory \\nand advanced payments are examples of non-monetary items. \\nReceivables and liabilities and other monetary item s denominated in foreign \\ncurrencies are translated using the foreign exchang e rate at the balance sheet \\ndate. The exchange gains and losses related to rece ivables and payables and \\nother operating receivables and liabilities are inc luded in âOther operating \\nincome and expensesâ and foreign exchange gains and  losses attributable to \\nother /f_inancial assets and liabilities are included in âFinancial income and \\nexpensesâ. Exchange rate di/uniFB00erences on translation to functional currency are \\nreported in other comprehensive income in the follo wing cases: \\nâ¢ translation of a /f_inancial liability designated as  a hedge of the net investment \\nin a foreign operation,\\nâ¢ translation of intra-group receivables from, or l iabilities to, a foreign opera -\\ntion that in substance is part of the net investmen t in the foreign operation,\\nâ¢ cash /f_low hedges of foreign currency to the extent  that the hedge is e/uniFB00ective. \\nIn the consolidation, the balance sheets of foreign  subsidiaries are translated to \\nSEK using exchange rates at the end of the reportin g period and the income \\nstatements are translated at the average rates for the reporting period. Foreign \\nexchange di/uniFB00erences arising on such translation are  recognized in other com -\\nprehensive income and are accumulated in the curren cy translation reserve in \\nequity. Exchange rates for major currencies that ha ve been used for the consoli -\\ndated /f_inancial statements are shown in note 27.\\nSegment reporting\\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group th at engages in business \\nactivities from which it may earn revenue and incur  expenses, and for which dis -\\ncrete /f_inancial information is available. The operat ing results of all operating \\nsegments are reviewed regularly by the Groupâs Pres ident and CEO, the chief \\noperating decision maker, to make decisions about a llocation of resources to \\nthe segments and also to assess their performance. See note 4 for additional \\ninformation.\\nRevenue recognition\\nRevenue is recognized at an amount that re/f_lects the  expected and entitled  \\nconsideration for transferring goods and/or service s to customers when control \\nhas passed to the customer.\\nGoods sold\\nRevenue from goods sold are recognized at one point  in time when control of \\nthe good has been transferred to the customer. This  occurs for example when \\nthe Group has a present right to payment for the go od, the customer has legal \\ntitle of the good, the good has been delivered to t he customer and/or the cus -\\ntomer has the signi/f_icant risks and rewards of the o wnership of the good.\\nWhen the goods sold are highly customized and an en forceable right to pay -\\nment is present, revenue is recognized over time us ing the proportion of cost \\nincurred to date compared to estimated total cost t o measure the progress \\ntowards complete satisfaction of that performance o bligation and thereby \\ntransferring the control of the good to the custome r. \\nFor buy-back commitments where the buy-back price i s lower than the origi -\\nnal selling price but there is an economic incentiv e for the customer to use the \\nbuy-back commitment option, the transaction is acco unted for as a lease. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\n68 Atlas Copco 2019Variable consideration\\nSome contracts with customers provide a right of re turn, trade discounts or vol -\\nume rebates. If revenue cannot be reliably measured , the Group defers revenue \\nuntil the uncertainty is resolved. Such liabilities  are estimated at contract incep -\\ntion and updated thereafter. \\nRights of return\\nWhen a contract with a customer provides a right to  return the good within a \\nspeci/f_ied period, the Group accounts for the right o f return using the expected \\nvalue method. The amount of revenue related to the expected returns is deferred \\nand recognized in the statement of /f_inancial positio n within âOther liabilitiesâ.  \\nA corresponding adjustment is made to the cost of s ales and recognized in the \\nstatement of /f_inancial position within âInventoriesâ .\\nRendering of service\\nRevenue from service is recognized over time by ref erence to the progress \\ntowards satisfaction of each performance obligation . The progress towards \\nsatisfaction of each performance obligation is meas ured by the proportion of \\ncost incurred to date compared to estimated total c ost of each performance \\nobligation. \\nWhere the outcome of a service contract cannot be e stimated reliably, reve -\\nnue is recognized to the extent of cost incurred th at are expected to be recover -\\nable. When it is probable that total contract costs  will exceed total revenue, the \\nexpected loss is recognized as an expense immediate ly. When the value of the \\nservice performed to the customer corresponds direc tly to the right to invoice \\nfor that service, revenue is recognized to the amou nt invoiced. \\nSpecialty rental\\nIncome from specialty rental is recognized on a str aight-line basis over the rental \\nperiod. The specialty rental business is considered  to be a service for the custom -\\ners as this includes a complete solution to the cus tomers to ful/f_ill the customer \\nneeds. Sale of equipment from the specialty rental business is recognized as rev -\\nenue when the control of the asset has been transfe rred to the buyer. Indicators \\nof transfer of control is explained under âGoods so ldâ see page 67. The carrying \\nvalue of the specialty rental equipment sold is rec ognized as cost of sales. Invest -\\nments in and sales of specialty rental equipment ar e included in cash /f_lows from \\noperating activities.\\nContract assets and contract liabilities\\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cas h collections results in billed \\naccount receivables, unbilled receivables (contract  assets), and customer \\nadvances and deposits (contract liabilities) in the  consolidated balance sheet. \\nBilling occurs either as work progresses in accorda nce with agreed-upon con -\\ntractual terms, upon achievement of contractual mil estones or when the con -\\ntrol of the goods has been transferred to the custo mer. Atlas Copco sometimes \\nreceives advances or deposits from customers, befor e revenue is recognized, \\nresulting in contract liabilities. These contract a ssets and contract liabilities are \\nreported in the consolidated balance sheet, in othe r receivables or other liabili -\\nties, on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of  each reporting period. Pay -\\nment terms range from contract to contract and are dependent upon the agree -\\nment with the customer. \\nPractical expedients\\nThe Group has elected to apply the following expedi ents:\\nFor the disclosure of the aggregate amount of the t ransaction price allocated \\nto the performance obligations that are unsatis/f_ied (or partially u nsatis/f_ied) at \\nthe end of the reporting period, the Group does not  disclose the value related to \\nthe following expedients:\\nâ¢ the performance obligation that is part of the con tract that has an original \\nexpected duration of one year or less, and\\nâ¢ the entity has a right to consideration from a cu stomer in an amount that cor -\\nresponds directly with the value to the customer of  the entityâs performance \\ncompleted to date.\\nFor incremental cost of obtaining the contract, the  Group uses the practical expe -\\ndient of recognizing the incremental cost as an exp ense if the amortization period \\nof the asset, that otherwise would have been recogn ized, is one year or less.\\nOther operating income and expenses\\nCommissions received are recognized on an accrual b asis in accordance with the \\n/f_inancial substance of the agreement. Gains and loss es on disposals of an item \\nof non-current tangible and intangible assets are d etermined by comparing the \\nproceeds from disposal with the carrying amount. Se e note 7 for additional \\ninformation.\\nFinancial income and expenses\\nInterest income and interest expenses are recognize d in pro/f_it or loss using the 1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements, continued\\ne/uniFB00ective interest method. Dividend income is recogn ized in pro/f_it or loss on the \\ndate that the Groupâs right to receive payment is e stablished. See note 8 for \\nadditional information.\\nIncome taxes \\nIncome taxes include both current and deferred taxe s. Income taxes are \\nreported in pro/f_it or loss unless the underlying tra nsaction is reported in other \\ncomprehensive income or in equity, in which case th e corresponding tax is \\nreported according to the same principle. \\nA current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or \\nrefundable for the current year or prior years. \\nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet liability method. The cal -\\nculation of deferred taxes is based on di/uniFB00erences b etween the values reported \\nin the balance sheet and their valuation for taxati on, which are referred to as \\ntemporary di/uniFB00erences, and the carry forward of unus ed tax losses and tax cred -\\nits. Temporary di/uniFB00erences attributable to the follo wing assets and liabilities are \\nnot provided for: the initial recognition of goodwi ll, the initial recognition (other \\nthan in business combinations) of assets or liabili ties that a/uniFB00ect neither account -\\ning nor taxable pro/f_it, and di/uniFB00erences related to in vestments in subsidiaries, \\nassociated companies and joint ventures to the exte nt that they will probably \\nnot reverse in the foreseeable future, and for whic h the Company is able to con -\\ntrol the timing of the reversal of the temporary di /uniFB00erences.\\nA deferred tax asset is recognized only to the exte nt that it is probable that \\nfuture taxable pro/f_its will be available against whi ch the asset can be utilized. In \\nthe calculation of deferred taxes, enacted or subst antively enacted tax rates are \\nused for the individual tax jurisdictions. \\nCurrent and deferred tax assets and liabilities are  o/uniFB00set when there is a legally \\nenforceable right to set o/uniFB00 current tax assets agai nst current tax liabilities and \\nwhen they relate to income taxes levied by the same  taxation authority and the \\nGroup intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. For \\ndetails regarding taxes, see note 9.\\nEarnings per share\\nBasic earnings per share are calculated based on th e pro/f_it for the year attribut -\\nable to owners of the parent and the basic weighted  average number of shares \\noutstanding. Diluted earnings per share are calcula ted based on the pro/f_it for \\nthe year attributable to owners of the parent and t he diluted weighted average \\nnumber of shares outstanding. Dilutive e/uniFB00ects arise  from stock options that are \\nsettled in shares, or that at the employeesâ choice  can be settled in shares or cash \\nin the share-based incentive programs. \\nStock options have a dilutive e/uniFB00ect when the averag e share price during the \\nperiod exceeds the exercise price of the options. W hen calculating the dilutive \\ne/uniFB00ect, the exercise price is adjusted by the value of future services related to the \\noptions. If options for which employees can choose settlement in shares or cash \\nare dilutive, the pro/f_it for the year is adjusted fo r the di/uniFB00erence between cash-\\nsettled and equity-settled treatment of options and  the more dilutive of cash \\nsettlement and share settlement is used in calculat ing earnings per share. See \\nnote 11 for more details.\\nIntangible assets\\nGoodwill \\nGoodwill is recognized at cost, as established at t he date of acquisition of a busi -\\nness (see âBusiness combinationsâ), less accumulate d impairment losses, if any. \\nGoodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to \\nbene/f_it from the synergies of the business combinati on. Impairment testing is \\nmade at least annually or whenever the need is indi cated. The impairment test is \\nperformed at the level on which goodwill is monitor ed for internal manage -\\nment purposes. The four business areas of Atlas Cop coâs operations have been \\nidenti/f_ied as CGUs. Goodwill is reported as an inde/f_i nite useful life intangible \\nasset. \\nTechnology-based intangible assets\\nExpenditure on research activities is expensed as i ncurred. Research projects \\nacquired as part of business combinations are initi ally recognized at their fair \\nvalue at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, thes e research \\nprojects are carried at cost less amortization and impairment losses. Expendi -\\nture on development activities are expensed as incu rred unless the activities \\nmeet the criteria for being capitalized i.e.: \\nâ¢ the product or process being developed is estimat ed to be technically and \\ncommercially feasible, and \\nâ¢ the Group has the intent and ability to complete and sell or use the product  \\nor process. \\nThe expenditure capitalized includes the cost of ma terials, direct labor, and \\nother costs directly attributable to the project. C apitalized development expen -\\nditure is carried at cost less accumulated amortiza tion and impairment losses. \\nAmortization related to research and development ex penditure for 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\nAtlas Copco 2019 69amounted to 792 (734). This has been reported as pa rt of research and develop -\\nment costs in the income statement since the Group follows up on the research \\nand development function as a whole.\\nTrademarks\\nTrademarks acquired by the Group are capitalized ba sed on their fair value at \\nthe time of acquisition. Certain trademarks are est imated to have an inde/f_inite \\nuseful life and are carried at cost less accumulate d impairment losses. They are \\ntested at least annually for impairment. Other trad emarks, which have /f_inite \\nuseful lives, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment \\nlosses.\\nMarketing and customer related intangible assets\\nAcquired marketing and customer related intangibles  are capitalized based on \\ntheir fair value at the time of acquisition and are  carried at cost less accumulated \\namortization and impairment losses.\\nOther intangible assets\\nAcquired intangible assets relating to contract-bas ed rights, such as licenses or \\nfranchise agreements, are capitalized based on thei r fair value at the time of \\nacquisition and carried at cost less accumulated am ortization and impairment \\nlosses. Expenditure on internally generated goodwil l, trademarks and similar \\nitems is expensed as incurred. Changes in the Group âs intangible assets during \\nthe year are described in note 12.\\nProperty, plant and equipment \\nItems of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and impairment losses. Cost of an item  of property, plant and \\nequipment comprises purchase price, import duties, and any cost directly attrib -\\nutable to bringing the asset to the location and co ndition for use. The cost also \\nincludes dismantlement and removal of the asset in the future if applicable. Bor -\\nrowing cost for assets that need a substantial peri od of time to get ready for \\ntheir intended use are included in the cost value u ntil the assets are substantially \\nready for their use or sale and are thereafter depr eciated over the useful life of \\nthe asset. The Group capitalizes costs on initial r ecognition and on replacement \\nof signi/f_icant parts of property, plant and equipmen t if it is probable that the \\nfuture economic bene/f_its embodied will /f_low to the Gr oup and the cost can be \\nmeasured reliably. All other costs are recognized a s an expense in pro/f_it or loss \\nwhen incurred.\\nRental equipment\\nThe rental /f_leet is comprised of diesel and electric  powered air compressors, \\ngenerators, air dryers, and to a lesser extent gene ral construction equipment. \\nRental equipment is initially recognized at cost an d is depreciated over the esti -\\nmated useful lives of the equipment. Rental equipme nt is depreciated to a resid -\\nual value estimated at 0â10% of cost.\\nDepreciation and amortization \\nDepreciation and amortization are calculated based on cost using the straight-\\nline method over the estimated useful life of the a sset. Parts of property, plant \\nand equipment with a cost that is signi/f_icant in rel ation to the total cost of the \\nitem are depreciated separately when the useful liv es of the parts do not coin -\\ncide with the useful lives of other parts of the it em. The following useful lives are \\nused for depreciation and amortization: \\nTechnology-based intangible assets 3â15 years\\nTrademarks with /f_inite lives 5â15 years \\nMarketing and customer related intangible assets 5â15 years\\nBuildings 25â50 years\\nMachinery and equipment 3â10 years\\nVehicles 4â5 years\\nComputer hardware and software 3â10 years\\nRental equipment 3â8 years\\nThe useful lives and residual values are reassessed  annually. Land, assets under con -\\nstruction, goodwill, and trademarks with inde/f_inite lives are not depreciated or \\namortized. For changes in the Groupâs property, pla nt and equipment see note 13.\\nLease â IFRS 16 \\nTransition method\\nThe Group applies the new standard, IFRS 16, from J anuary 1, 2019. The new \\nstandard replaces IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determi ning whether an Arrange -\\nment contains a Lease. The Group has performed the transition by using the \\nmodi/f_ied retrospective approach, which does not requ ire restatement of  \\ncomparative periods. The comparative information co ntinues to be reported  \\nin accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The accounti ng principles for the com -1.

Leases that, at the com -\\nmencement date, had a lease term of 12 months or le ss are not recognized as \\nleases in the balance sheet. The Group has elected to apply the exemption for \\nleases for which the underlying asset is of low val ue regarding o/uniFB03ce equipment \\nsuch as printers and computers. \\nAll /f_inance leases are excluded at transition as wel l as leases where the lease \\nterm ends prior to January 1, 2020. For short-term leases and leases where the \\nunderlying asset are of low value, the Group recogn ized lease payments as an \\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the lease ter m. \\nNon-lease components such as service components and  other variable com -\\nponents that do not depend on an index or price are  accounted for as expenses, \\nif they could be separated in the contracts for the  leased asset. In most cases  \\nservice components are variable and based on for ex ample consumption.\\nFor leases of other assets, previously classi/f_ied as  operating leases under IAS \\n17, the Group recognized right-of-use assets and le ase liabilities.\\nLeases previously classi/f_ied as /f_inance leases\\nLeases that were classi/f_ied as /f_inance leases under I AS 17 were determined at \\nthe carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and l ease liability at January 1, \\n2019. \\nGroup as a lessor\\nLessor accounting is substantially unchanged from t he accounting under IAS 17, \\nexcept for sub-lease contracts. Under IFRS 16, sub- lease contracts that were pre -\\nviously classi/f_ied as an operating lease is required  to be assessed with reference \\nto the right-of-use asset instead of the underlying  asset.\\nImpacts on /f_inancial statements \\nAt transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognized an a dditional 3 259 MSEK of right-\\nof-use assets and 3 284 MSEK of lease liabilities. The di/uniFB00erence between right-\\nof-use assets and lease liabilities refers to prepa id or accrued lease payments \\nand /f_inancial lease receivables on agreements from s ubleasing. \\nThe Group discounted lease payments using its incre mental borrowing rate \\nat January 1, 2019, the weighted-average rate for t he Group was 2.2% at transi -\\ntion.

The interest portion of the lease payment remains as \\ncash /f_low from operating activities and is included in net /f_inancial items paid.\\nGroup as lessee\\nRecognition of a lease\\nUpon initiation, contracts are assessed by the Grou p, to determine whether a \\ncontract is, or contains a lease. If the contract c onveys the right to control the use \\nof an identi/f_ied asset for a certain period of time in exchange for consideration, \\nthen it is or contains a lease. The right to contro l the use of an identi/f_iable asset is \\nassessed by the Group based upon if there is an ide nti/f_iable asset, if the Group \\nhas the right to obtain substantially all economic bene/f_its from the use of the \\nasset and if the Group has the right to steer the u se of the asset. The policy is \\napplied to contracts entered into, or changed, on o r after January 1, 2019. The \\nGroup has elected to separate the non-lease compone nts and also elected to \\napply a number of practical expedients with regard to short-term leases and \\nleases for which the underlying asset is of low val ue. In cases where the Group \\nacts as an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its  interests in the head-lease and \\nthe sub-lease separately.\\nMeasurement of a right-of-use asset and lease liabi lity\\nRight-of-use asset\\nOn commencement date, the Group measures the right- of-use asset at cost, \\nwhich includes the following: the initial amount of  the lease liability adjusted for \\nany lease payments made at or before the commenceme nt date, less any lease \\nincentives received and any initial direct costs in curred by the Group as well as \\nan estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in  dismantling and removing \\nthe underlying asset, restoring the site on which i t is located or restoring the \\nunderlying asset to the condition required by the l ease contract. Cost for dis -\\nmantling, removing or restoring the site on which i t is located and/or the under -\\nlying asset is only recognized when the Group incur s an obligation to do so.\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the leas e term, using the straight-\\nline method.  \\nLease liability\\nOn commencement date, the lease liability is measur ed at the present value of \\nthe unpaid lease payments, discounted using the int erest rate implicit in the \\nlease, or if the rate cannot be readily determined,  the Groupâs incremental bor -\\nrowing rate. Lease payments included in the lease l iability comprise of /f_ixed pay -\\nments, variable lease payments that depend on an in dex or a rate, amounts to \\nbe paid under a residual value guarantee and lease payments in an optional \\nrenewal period if the Group is reasonably certain t o exercise an extension option \\nas well as penalties for early termination of a lea se, if the Group is reasonably \\ncertain to terminate early. If there is a purchase option present, this will be \\nincluded if the Group is reasonably certain to exer cise the option. \\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost b y using the e/uniFB00ective interest \\nrate method.\\nShort-term leases and leases for which the underlyi ng asset is of low value\\nThe Group has elected to apply recognition exemptio ns for short-term leases \\nand leases for which the underlying asset is of low  value, for example o/uniFB03ce \\nequipment such as printers and computers. Lease pay ments associated with \\nthose leases are recognized as an expense on a stra ight-line basis over the lease \\nterm. \\nGroup as a lessor\\nAt inception of a lease contract, the Group assess whether the lease is a /f_inance \\nlease or an operating lease. If the lease transfers  substantially all of the risks and \\nrewards incidental to ownership of the asset, it is  considered to be a /f_inance \\nlease; if not, it is an operating lease. Under /f_inan ce leases where the Group acts \\nas lessor, the transaction is recognized as a sale and a lease receivable, compris -\\ning the future minimum lease payments and any resid ual value guaranteed to \\nthe Group. Lease payments are recognized as repayme nt of the lease receivable \\nand interest income. In cases where the Group acts as a lessor under an operat -\\ning lease, the lease payments are included in pro/f_it  or loss on a straight-line basis \\nover the term of the lease. \\nIn cases where the Group acts as an intermediate le ssor, it accounts for its \\ninterests in the head-lease and the sub-lease separ ately. The Group assesses the \\nlease classi/f_ication of a sub-lease with reference t o the right-of-use asset arising \\nfrom the head-lease. \\nLease â IAS 17 (comparative /f_igures)\\nThe Group acts both as lessor and lessee. Leases ar e classi/f_ied as either /f_inance \\nleases or operating leases. A /f_inance lease entails the transfer to the lessee of \\nsubstantially all of the economic risks and bene/f_its  associated with ownership. If \\nthis is not the case, the lease is accounted for as  an operating lease.1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements, continued\\nGroup as lessee\\nFor the Group, a /f_inancial lease implies that the /f_ix ed asset leased is recognized \\nas an asset in the balance sheet. Initially, a corr esponding liability is recorded. \\nUpon initial recognition, the leased asset is measu red at an amount equal to the \\nlower of its fair value and the present value of th e future minimum lease pay -\\nments. Fixed assets under /f_inance leases are depreci ated over their estimated \\nuseful lives, while the lease payments are reported  as interest and amortization \\nof the lease liability. For operating leases, the G roup does not account for the \\nleased asset in its balance sheet. The costs of ope rating leases are recorded in \\nthe income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \\nGroup as lessor\\nIn cases where the Group acts as the lessor under a n operating lease, the asset is \\nclassi/f_ied as rental equipment and is subject to the  Groupâs depreciation poli -\\ncies. The lease payments are included in pro/f_it or l oss on a straight-line basis over \\nthe term of the lease. Under /f_inance leases where th e Group acts as lessor, the \\ntransaction is recorded as a sale and a lease recei vable, comprising the future \\nminimum lease payments and any residual value guara nteed to the Group. \\nLease payments are recognized as interest income an d repayment of the lease \\nreceivable. See note 22 for more details on leases.\\nImpairment of non-/f_inancial assets\\nThe carrying values of the Groupâs non-/f_inancial ass ets are reviewed at least at \\neach reporting date to determine whether there is a ny indication of impair -\\nment. If any such indication exists, the Group esti mates the recoverable amount \\nof the asset. An impairment loss is recognized if t he carrying amount of an asset \\nor its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recov erable amount (i.e. the \\ngreater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). In assessing the value in \\nuse, the estimated future cash /f_lows are discounted to their present value using \\na discount rate that re/f_lects current market assessm ents of the time value of \\nmoney and the risks speci/f_ic to the asset or CGU. Fo r the purpose of assessing \\nimpairment, assets are grouped in CGUs, which are t he smallest identi/f_iable \\ngroups of assets that generate cash in/f_lows that are  largely independent of the \\ncash in/f_lows from other assets or group of assets. I mpairment losses are recog -\\nnized in pro/f_it or loss. An impairment loss related to goodwill is not reversed. In \\nrespect of other assets, impairment losses in prior  periods are reviewed for pos -\\nsible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\\nInventories\\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net  realizable value. Net realiz -\\nable value is the estimated selling price for inven tories less all estimated costs of \\ncompletion and costs necessary to make the sale. In ventories are recognized \\naccording to the /f_irst-in, /f_irst-out principle and in cludes the cost of acquiring \\ninventories and bringing them to their existing loc ation and condition. Invento -\\nries manufactured by the Group and work in progress  include an appropriate \\nshare of production overheads based on normal opera ting capacity. Inventories \\nare reported net of deductions for obsolescence and  internal pro/f_its arising in \\nconnection with deliveries from the production comp anies to the customer cen -\\nters. See note 16 for more details.\\nEquity \\nShares issued by the company are classi/f_ied as equit y. Incremental costs directly \\nattributable to the issue of ordinary shares and sh are options are recognized as \\na deduction from equity, net of any tax e/uniFB00ect.\\nWhen Atlas Copco shares are repurchased, the amount  of the consideration \\npaid is recognized as a deduction from equity net o f any tax e/uniFB00ect. Repurchased \\nshares are classi/f_ied as treasury shares and are pre sented as a deduction from \\ntotal equity. When treasury shares are sold or subs equently reissued, the \\namount received is recognized as an increase in equ ity and the resulting surplus \\nor de/f_icit on the transaction is transferred to or f rom Other paid-in capital. \\nSupply chain /f_inancing\\nThe Group and Banks, with close relations to Atlas Copco, o/uniFB00er suppliers the \\nopportunity to use a supply chain /f_inancing scheme ( âSCFâ) which allows them \\nto be paid earlier than the invoice due date. The G roup evaluates supplier \\narrangements against a number of indicators to asse ss if the payable continues \\nto hold characteristics of a trade payable or shoul d be classi/f_ied as borrowings; \\nthese indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary pay -\\nment terms in the industry. These transactions has been recognized as either \\nâAccount payablesâ or âBorrowingsâ in the Groupâs b alance sheet and as \\nâChange in operating liabilitiesâ or change in âBor rowingsâ or âRepayment of \\nborrowingsâ in the statement of cash /f_lows. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\nAtlas Copco 2019 71Provisions\\nProvisions are recognized:\\nâ¢  when the Group has a legal or constructive oblig ation as a result of a  \\npast event, \\nâ¢ it is probable that the Group will have to settle  the obligation, and \\nâ¢ the amount of the obligation can be estimated rel iably. \\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best es timate of the consideration \\nrequired to settle the present obligation at the ba lance sheet date. \\nIf the e/uniFB00ect of the time value of money is material , the provision is deter -\\nmined by discounting the expected future cash /f_lows of estimated expendi -\\ntures.\\nProvisions for product warranties are recognized as  cost of sales at the time \\nthe products are sold based on the estimated cost u sing historical data for level \\nof repairs and replacements.\\nA restructuring provision is recognized when the Gr oup has approved a \\ndetailed and formal restructuring plan and the rest ructuring has either com -\\nmenced or been announced publicly.\\nPresent obligations arising under onerous contracts  are recognized as provi -\\nsions. An onerous contract is considered to exist w here the Group has a contract \\nunder which the unavoidable costs of meeting the ob ligations under the con -\\ntract exceed the economic bene/f_its expected to be re ceived from the contract. \\nBefore a provision is established, the Group recogn izes any impairment loss on \\nthe asset associated with the contract. For details  on provisions see note 25. \\nPost-employment bene/f_its\\nPost-employment bene/f_it plans are classi/f_ied either a s de/f_ined contribution or \\nde/f_ined bene/f_it plans. Under a de/f_ined contribution pl an, the Group pays /f_ixed \\ncontributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obli -\\ngation to pay further amounts if the fund does not hold su/uniFB03cient assets to pay \\nall employee bene/f_its. Contributions to de/f_ined contr ibutions plans are \\nexpensed when employees provide services entitling them to the contribution. \\nOther post-employment bene/f_it plans are de/f_ined bene/f_i t plans and it is the \\nGroupâs obligation to provide agreed bene/f_its to cur rent and former employees. \\nThe net obligation of de/f_ined bene/f_it plans is calcul ated by estimating the \\namount of future bene/f_its that employees have earned  in return for their ser -\\nvices in current and prior periods. The amount is d iscounted to determine its \\npresent value and the fair values of any plan asset s are deducted. Funded plans \\nwith net assets, i.e. plans with assets exceeding t he commitments, are reported \\nas /f_inancial non-current assets. \\nThe cost for de/f_ined bene/f_it plans is calculated usin g the Projected Unit Credit \\nMethod, which distributes the cost over the employe eâs service period. The cal -\\nculation is performed annually by independent actua ries using actuarial \\nassumptions such as employee turnover, mortality, f uture increase in salaries \\nand medical cost. Changes in actuarial assumptions,  experience adjustments of \\nobligations and changes in fair value of plan asset s result in remeasurements \\nand are recognized in other comprehensive income. E ach quarter a remeasure -\\nment is performed to adjust the present value of pe nsion liabilities and the fair \\nvalue of pension assets against other comprehensive  income. Net interest on \\nde/f_ined bene/f_it obligations and plan assets is report ed as interest income or \\ninterest expenses. See note 23 for additional infor mation.\\nShare-based compensation \\nThe Group has share-based incentive programs, consi sting of share options and \\nshare appreciation rights, which have been o/uniFB00ered t o certain employees based \\non position and performance. Additionally, the Boar d is o/uniFB00ered synthetic \\nshares. The fair value of share options that can on ly be settled in shares (equity-\\nsettled) is recognized as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in \\nequity. The fair value, measured at grant date usin g the Black-Scholes formula, is \\nrecognized as an expense over the vesting period. T he amount recognized as an \\nexpense is adjusted to re/f_lect the actual number of share options that vest. The \\nfair value of the share appreciation rights, synthe tic shares, and options with a \\nchoice for employees to settle in shares or cash is  recognized in accordance with \\nprinciples for cash-settled share-based payments. T he value is recognized as an \\nemployee expense with a corresponding increase in l iabilities. The fair value, \\nmeasured at grant date and remeasured at each repor ting date using the Black-\\nScholes formula, is accrued and recognized as an ex pense over the vesting \\nperiod. Changes in fair value are, during the vesti ng period and after the vesting \\nperiod until settlement, recognized in pro/f_it or los s as an employee expense. \\nThe accumulated expense recognized equals the cash amount paid at settle -\\nment. \\nSocial security charges are paid in cash and are ac counted for in consistence \\nwith the principles for cash-settled share-based pa yments, regardless of \\nwhether they are related to equity- or cash-settled  share-based payments. See \\nnote 23 for details.1.

Tra nsactions of /f_inancial assets \\nare accounted for at trade date, which is the day w hen the Group contractually \\ncommits to acquire or dispose of the assets. Trade receivables are recognized on \\nissuance of invoices. Liabilities are recognized wh en the other party has per -\\nformed and there is a contractual obligation to pay . Derecognition, fully or par -\\ntially, of a /f_inancial asset occurs when the rights in the contract have been real -\\nized or mature, or when the Group no longer has con trol over it.

Financial instruments in this category are recognized at fair valu e at initial \\nrecognition and changes in fair value are recognize d in other comprehensive \\nincome (OCI) until derecognition, when the amounts in OCI are reclassi/f_ied to \\npro/f_it or loss. The assets are subject to a loss all owance for expected credit \\nlosses.\\nFair value through pro/f_it or loss (FVTPL) are all ot her debt instruments that \\nare not measured at amortized cost or FVOCI. Financ ial instruments in this cate -\\ngory are recognized at fair value at initial recogn ition and changes in fair value \\nare recognized in pro/f_it or loss.\\nClassi/f_ication and measurement of /f_inancial liabiliti es\\nFinancial liabilities are classi/f_ied at amortized co st, except derivatives. Financial \\nliabilities at amortized cost are at initial recogn ition measured at fair value \\nincluding transaction costs. After initial recognit ion, they are measured at the \\ne/uniFB00ective interest rate method. \\nDerivatives are classi/f_ied at FVTPL, unless they are  classi/f_ied as a hedging \\ninstrument and the e/uniFB00ective part of the hedge is re cognized in other compre -\\nhensive income.\\nFair value for /f_inancial assets and /f_inancial liabili ties is determined in the  \\nmanner described in note 27.\\nImpairment of /f_inancial assets\\nFinancial assets, except those classi/f_ied at fair va lue through pro/f_it and loss \\n(FVTPL), are subject to impairment for expected cre dit losses. In addition, the \\nimpairment model applies to contract assets, loan c ommitments and /f_inancial \\nguarantees that are not measured at FVTPL. The IFRS  9 expected credit loss \\n(ECL) model is forward looking and a loss allowance  is recognized when there is \\nan exposure to credit risk, usually at /f_irst recogni tion of an asset or receivable. \\nThe ECL re/f_lects the present value of all cash short falls related to default events \\neither over the following 12 months or over the exp ected life of a /f_inancial \\ninstrument, depending on the type of asset and on t he credit deterioration from \\ninception. The ECL re/f_lects an unbiased, probability -weighted outcome that \\nconsiders multiple scenarios based on reasonable an d supportable forecasts. \\nThe simpli/f_ied model is applied on trade receivables , lease receivables, con -\\ntract assets and certain other /f_inancial receivables . A loss allowance is recog -\\nnized over the expected lifetime of the receivable or asset. For other items sub -\\nject to ECL, the impairment model with a three-stag e approach is applied. Ini -\\ntially, and at each reporting date, a loss allowanc e will be recognized for the fol -\\nlowing 12 months, or a shorter time period dependin g on the time to maturity \\n(stage 1). If it has been a signi/f_icant increase in credit risk since origination, a loss \\nallowance will be recognized for the remaining life time of the asset (stage 2). \\nFor assets that are considered as credit impaired, allowance for credit losses will \\ncontinue to capture the lifetime expected credit lo sses (stage 3). For credit \\nimpaired receivables and assets, the interest reven ue is calculated based on the \\ncarrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allow ance, rather than its gross car -\\nrying amount as in previous stages.\\nIn the respective model applied, the measurement of  ECL is based on di/uniFB00er -\\nent methods for di/uniFB00erent credit risk exposures. For  trade receivables, contract \\nassets and certain other /f_inancial receivables, the method is based on historical \\nloss rates in combination with forward looking cons iderations. Lease receiv -\\nables, certain other /f_inancial receivables and cash and cash equivalent are \\nimpaired by a rating method, where ECL is measured by the product of the prob -\\nability of default, loss given default, and exposur e at default. Both external \\ncredit agencies rating and internally developed rat ing methods are applied. \\nThe measurement of ECL considers potential collater als and other credit \\nenhancements in the form of guarantees.\\nThe /f_inancial assets are presented in the /f_inancial s tatements at amortized \\ncost, i.e. net of gross carrying amount and the los s allowance. Changes in the \\nloss allowance is recognized in pro/f_it or loss as im pairment losses.\\nDerivatives and hedge accounting\\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract \\nis entered into and are subsequently measured at fa ir value. The method of rec -\\nognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whet her the derivative is desig -\\nnated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the natur e of the item hedged. \\nChanges in fair value for derivatives that do not f ul/f_ill the criteria for hedge \\naccounting are recognized as operating or /f_inancial transactions based on the \\npurpose of the use of the derivative. Interest paym ents for interest rate swaps \\nare recognized as interest income or expense, where as changes in fair value of \\nfuture payments are presented as gains or losses fr om /f_inancial instruments. \\nIFRS 9 Hedge accounting is applied. In order to qua lify for hedge accounting  \\nthe hedging relationship must be:1. Signi/f_icant accounting principles, critical accounti ng estimates and judgements, continued\\nâ¢ formally identi/f_ied and designated,\\nâ¢ expected to ful/f_il the e/uniFB00ectiveness requirements, and\\nâ¢ documented.\\nThe Group assesses, evaluates, and documents e/uniFB00ecti veness both at hedge \\ninception and on an ongoing basis. Hedge e/uniFB00ectivene ss is assessed by an analy -\\nsis of the economic relationship between the hedged  item and the hedging \\ninstrument, and the e/uniFB00ect of credit risk must not d ominate the value changesâ \\nthat result from that economic relationship. Furthe r, the hedge ratio, as de/f_ined \\nin the GroupÂ´s risk management strategy, must be th e same in the hedging rela -\\ntionship as in the actually hedge performed. \\nCash /f_low hedges:  Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrumen t are rec -\\nognized in other comprehensive income to the extent  that the hedge is e/uniFB00ective \\nand the accumulated changes in fair value are recog nized as a separate compo -\\nnent in equity. Gains or losses relating to the ine /uniFB00ective part of hedges are rec -\\nognized immediately in pro/f_it or loss. \\nThe amount recognized in equity through other compr ehensive income is \\nreversed to pro/f_it or loss in the same period in whi ch the hedged item a/uniFB00ects \\npro/f_it or loss. However, when the hedged forecast tr ansaction results in the rec -\\nognition of a non-/f_inancial asset or a non-/f_inancial liability, the amount previ -\\nously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is \\ntransferred from equity and included in the initial  measurement of the cost of \\nthe non-/f_inancial asset or liability. The Group uses  foreign currency forwards to \\nhedge part of the future cash /f_lows from forecasted transactions in foreign cur -\\nrencies. Interest rate swaps are also used as cash /f_low hedges for hedging inter -\\nest on borrowings with variable interest.\\nHedge of net investments in foreign operations:  The Group hedges a substantial \\npart of net investments in foreign operations. Chan ges in the value of the hedge \\ninstrument relating to the e/uniFB00ective portion of the hedge are recognized in other \\ncomprehensive income and accumulated in equity. Gai ns or losses relating to \\nthe ine/uniFB00ective portion are recognized immediately i n pro/f_it or loss. On divest -\\nment of foreign operations, the gain or loss accumu lated in equity is recycled \\nthrough pro/f_it or loss, increasing or decreasing the  pro/f_it or loss on the divest -\\nment. The Group uses loans and forward contracts as  hedging instruments.\\nAccounting for discontinuation of hedges: Hedge accounting may not be  \\nvoluntarily discontinued. Hedge accounting is disco ntinued: \\nâ¢  when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, \\nâ¢  when there is no longer an economic relationship  between the hedged item \\nand the hedging instrument or the e/uniFB00ect of credit r isk dominates the value \\nchanges that result from the economic relationship,  or \\nâ¢ when the hedge accounting no longer meets the ris k management  \\nobjectives. \\nFor cash /f_low hedges, any gain or loss recognized in  other comprehensive \\nincome and accumulated in equity at the time of hed ge discontinuation remains \\nin equity and is recognized when the forecast trans action is ultimately recog -\\nnized in pro/f_it or loss. When a forecast transaction  is no longer expected to \\noccur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is re cognized immediately in pro/f_it \\nor loss. For net investment hedges, any gain and lo ss recognized in other com -\\nprehensive income and accumulated in equity at the time of hedge discontinua -\\ntion remains in equity until divestment of foreign operations, when the gain or \\nloss accumulated in equity is recycled through pro/f_i t or loss. \\nAssets held for sale and discontinued operations\\nAssets are classi/f_ied as held for sale if their valu e, within one year, will be recov -\\nered through a sale and not through continued use i n the operations. On the \\nreclassi/f_ication date, assets and liabilities are me asured at the lower of fair value \\nless selling expenses and the carrying amount. Gain s and losses recognized on \\nremeasurements and disposals are reported in pro/f_it or loss.  \\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Grou p that either has been \\ndisposed of, or is classi/f_ied as held for sale, and represents a separate major line \\nof business or geographical area of operations. A d iscontinued operation is \\nreported separately from continuing operations in th e income statement with \\nthe corresponding presentation for the comparative period. In the balance \\nsheet assets held for sale and associated liabiliti es are reported separately, the \\ncomparative period is not a/uniFB00ected. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower \\nof carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell .\\nEpiroc was distributed during 2018 and has been rec ognized according to  \\nthe rules concerning discontinued operations (IFRS 5). Epirocâs pro/f_it for the com -\\nparative period and up to the distribution and the capital gain generated by the \\ndistribution have been recognized in the line â Pro /f_it from discontinued opera -\\ntions, net of tax.

This amendment permits more assets to be measured at amor -\\ntized cost than previously allowed, in particular c ertain pre-payable /f_inancial \\nassets with negative compensation. To qualify for t he amortized cost measure -\\nment, the negative compensation must be reasonable compensation for early \\ntermination of the contract. To be applicable for s uch handling, the asset must \\nbe held within a âhold to collectâ business model.\\n This amendment also clari/f_ies that when there are m odi/f_ications relating to a \\n/f_inancial liability measured at amortized cost, whic h do not lead to derecogni -\\ntion of the /f_inancial liability, a gain or loss shou ld be recognized in the pro/f_it and \\nloss. This gain or loss is calculated by comparing the initial contractual cash /f_low \\nwith the modi/f_ied cash /f_low discounted at the origina l e/uniFB00ective interest rate. \\nAmendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment o r Settlement \\nThe amendment clari/f_ies that the Group must, if a pl an amendment, curtail -\\nment or settlement occurs, determine the current se rvice cost and the net inter -\\nest for the period using the assumptions it used fo r the remeasurement. Fur -\\nthermore, the amendment clari/f_ies the e/uniFB00ect of a pla n amendment, curtailment \\nor settlement on the requirements regarding the ass et ceiling.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\n74 Atlas Copco 2019CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS \\nThe preparation of /f_inancial reports requires manage mentâs judgement and the \\nuse of estimates and assumptions that a/uniFB00ects the am ounts reported in the con -\\nsolidated /f_inancial statements. These estimates and associated assumptions are \\nbased on historical experience and various other fa ctors that are believed to be \\nreasonable under the prevailing circumstances. Actu al result may di/uniFB00er from \\nthose estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going \\nbasis. Changes in accounting estimates are recogniz ed in the period which they \\nare revised in and in any future periods a/uniFB00ected.\\nThe estimates and the judgements which, in the opin ion of management, are \\nsigni/f_icant to the underlying amounts included in th e /f_inancial reports and for \\nwhich there is a signi/f_icant risk that future events  or new information could \\nentail a change in those estimates or judgements ar e as follows:\\nRevenue recognition\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nRevenue for services and for highly customized good s where an enforceable \\nright of payment is present is recognized over time  in pro/f_it or loss by reference \\nto the progress towards satisfaction of the perform ance obligation at the bal -\\nance sheet date. The progress towards satisfaction is determined by the propor -\\ntion of cost incurred to date compared to the estim ated total cost of each per -\\nformance obligation. There is always an uncertainty  if the total estimated \\nexpenditure is correctly calculated, and if the exp enditure incurred re/f_lects \\naccurately the actual costs incurred, which means t hat there is uncertainty in the \\nestimates of the degree of completion of the work p erformed. Management \\nhas assessed this method of determining the progres s towards satisfaction of \\nthe performance obligation as most suitable as it r e/f_lects the progression of \\nwork performed, and the enforceable right of paymen t from the customer as \\nthe costs are incurred on the performance obligatio ns. \\nRevenue for goods sold is recognized in pro/f_it or lo ss at one point in time \\nwhen control of the good has been transferred to th e customer. \\nAccounting judgement\\nManagementâs judgement is used, for instance, when assessing:\\nâ¢ the degree of progress towards satisfaction of th e performance obligations \\nand the estimated total costs for such contracts wh en revenue is recognized \\nover time, to determine the revenue and cost to be recognized in the current \\nperiod, and whether any losses need to be recognize d, \\nâ¢ if the control has been transferred to the custom er (for example the Group has \\na present right to payment for the good, the custom er has legal title of the \\ngood, the good has been delivered to the customer a nd/or the customer has \\nthe signi/f_icant risks and rewards of the ownership o f the good), to determine \\nif revenue and cost should be recognized in the cur rent period,\\nâ¢ the transaction price of each performance obligat ion when a contract \\nincludes more than one performance obligation, to d etermine the revenue \\nand cost to be recognized in the current period,\\nâ¢ certain contracts which include a right of return  and/or volume rebates that \\ngive rise to variable consideration, variable consi deration is assessed to iden -\\ntify possible constrains, and\\nâ¢ the customer credit risk (i.e. the risk that the customer will not meet the  \\npayment obligation), to determine and justify the r evenue recognized in the \\ncurrent period. \\nImpairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and  other  \\nlong-lived assets\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nGoodwill and certain trademarks are not amortized b ut are subject to annual \\ntests for impairment. Other intangible assets and o ther long-lived assets are \\namortized or depreciated based on managementâs esti mates of the period that \\nthe assets will generate revenue but are also revie wed regularly for indications \\nof impairment. The impairment tests are based on a review of the recoverable \\namount, which is estimated based on managementâs pr ojections of future cash \\n/f_lows using internal business plans and forecasts. Accounting judgement\\nAsset impairment requires managementâs judgement, p articularly in assessing: \\nâ¢  whether an event has occurred that may a/uniFB00ect ass et values, \\nâ¢ whether the carrying value of an asset can be sup ported by the net present \\nvalue of future cash /f_lows, which are estimated base d upon the continued use \\nof the asset in the business,  \\nâ¢ the appropriate assumptions to be applied in prep aring cash /f_low projections, \\nand\\nâ¢ the discounting of these cash /f_lows.\\nChanging the assumptions selected by management to determine the level, if \\nany, of impairment could a/uniFB00ect the /f_inancial positio n and results of operation. \\nSee note 12.\\nDeferred taxes\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for temporary di /uniFB00erences between the car -\\nrying amounts for /f_inancial reporting purposes of as sets and liabilities and the \\namounts used for taxation purposes and for tax loss  carry-forwards. The Group \\nrecords deferred tax assets based upon managementâs  estimates of future tax -\\nable pro/f_it in di/uniFB00erent tax jurisdictions. The actua l results may di/uniFB00er from these \\nestimates, due to change in the business climate an d change in tax legislation. \\nSee note 9.\\nInventory\\nAccounting judgement\\nThe Group values inventory at the lower of historic al cost, based on the /f_irst-in, \\n/f_irst-out basis, and net realizable value. The calcu lation of net realizable value \\ninvolves managementâs judgement on the estimated sa les prices, over-stock \\narticles, outdated articles, damaged goods, and sel ling costs. If the estimated \\nnet realizable value is lower than cost, a valuatio n allowance is established for \\ninventory obsolescence. See note 16 for additional information.\\nLeases \\nAccounting judgement \\nThe Group has several lease contracts that include extension options. The Group \\napplies judgement in evaluating the lease term, it considers all facts and circum -\\nstances that create an economic incentive to exerci se an extension option. \\nExtension options are only included in the lease te rm if the lease is reasonably \\ncertain to be extended. For leases of premises, the  following factors are nor -\\nmally the most relevant:\\nâ¢ If any leasehold improvements are expected to hav e a signi/f_icant remaining \\nvalue, the Group is typically reasonably certain to  extend.\\nâ¢ Otherwise, the Group considers other factors incl uding historical lease dura -\\ntions and the costs and business disruption require d to replace the leased \\nasset.\\nThe renewal periods for leases of o/uniFB03ces and warehou se premises with exten -\\nsion options exceeding 10 to 15 years are not inclu ded as part of the lease term \\nas these are not reasonably certain to be exercised . In addition, renewal options \\nfor leases of motor vehicles are not part of the le ase term because the Group \\ntypically leases motor vehicles for not more than t hree to /f_ive years and, hence, is \\nnot exercising any renewal options. \\n After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is \\na signi/f_icant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and \\na/uniFB00ects its ability to exercise the option to renew.  Refer to note 22 for informa -\\ntion on potential future rental payments relating t o extension options that are \\nnot included in the lease term. \\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty: \\nWhen the Group cannot readily determine the interes t rate implicit in the lease, \\nit uses incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure  lease liabilities. The IBR is \\nthe rate of interest that the Group would have to p ay to borrow over similar \\nterms which requires estimations when no observable  rates are available. The \\nGroup estimates the IBR by using market interest ra tes and adjusting with entity \\nspeci/f_ic estimates such as currency and country risk .1.

The expected credit losses for tra de receivables and contract \\nassets are an assessment of speci/f_ic loss provisions  corresponding to individually \\nsigni/f_icant exposures as well as historical loss rat es in combination with forward \\nlooking considerations. The expected credit losses for lease receivables and \\n/f_inancial receivables are an assessment that re/f_lects  an unbiased, probability-\\nweighted outcome based on reasonable and supportabl e forecasts. \\nAccounting judgement:  \\nManagementâs judgement considers rapidly changing m arket conditions. An \\noverlay control is performed to ensure that an adeq uate loss allowance is recog -\\nnized. Additional information is included in sectio n âCredit riskâ in note 27.  \\nPension and other post-employment bene/f_it valuation assumptions\\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\\nPensions and other post-employment obligations are dependent on the \\nassumptions established by management and used by a ctuaries in calculating \\nsuch amounts. The key assumptions include discount rates, in/f_lation, future  \\nsalary increases, mortality rates, and healthcare-c ost trend rates. The actuarial \\nassumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and are  changed when it is \\ndeemed appropriate. \\nSee note 23 for additional information regarding as sumptions used in the \\ncalculation of pension and post-employment obligations. Legal proceedings and tax claims\\nAccounting judgement \\nAtlas Copco recognizes a liability when the Group h as an obligation from a past \\nevent involving the transfer of economic bene/f_its an d when a reasonable esti -\\nmate can be made of what the transfer might be. The  Group reviews outstand -\\ning legal cases regularly in order to assess the ne ed for provisions in the /f_inancial \\nstatements. These reviews consider the factors of t he speci/f_ic case by internal \\nlegal counsel and through the use of outside legal counsel and advisors when \\nnecessary. The /f_inancial statements may be a/uniFB00ected t o the extent that manage -\\nmentâs assessments of the factors considered are no t consistent with the actual \\noutcome.\\nAdditionally, the legal entities of the Group are f requently subject to audits \\nby tax authorities in accordance with standard prac tice in the countries where \\nthe Group operates.

Employee bene/f_its\\nPost-employment bene/f_its\\nAtlas Copco provides post-employment de/f_ined bene/f_it pensions and other \\nlong-term employee bene/f_its in most of its major loc ations. The most signi/f_icant \\ncountries in terms of size of plans are Belgium, Ge rmany, Sweden, the United \\nKingdom and the United States. Some plans are funde d in advance with certain \\nassets or funds held separately from the Group for future bene/f_it payment obli -\\ngations. Other plans are unfunded and the bene/f_its f rom those plans are paid by \\nthe Group as they fall due. \\nThe plans in Belgium cover early retirement, jubile e, and termination indem -\\nnity and are all unfunded. \\nIn Canada, the pension plan and the supplemental re tirement pension bene -\\n/f_it plan for executives, both funded, were wound up in 2019. There are also two \\nunfunded plans, a post-retirement bene/f_it plan and a  post-employment plan. \\nThe plans in Germany cover pensions, early retireme nts and jubilee.

The ITP plan is a \\n/f_inal salary pension plan covering the majority of w hite-collar employees in \\nSweden. Atlas Copco /f_inances the bene/f_its through a p ension foundation. The \\nsecond plan relates to a group of employees earning  more than ten income base \\namounts that has opted out from the ITP plan. This plan is insured. The third \\nde/f_ined bene/f_it pension plan relates to former senior  employees now retired. In \\nSweden, in addition to bene/f_its relating to retireme nt pensions, Atlas Copco has \\nobligations for family pensions for many of the Swe dish employees, which are \\nfunded through a third-party insurer, Alecta. This plan is accounted for as a \\nde/f_ined contribution plan as su/uniFB03cient information fo r calculating the net pen -\\nsion obligation is not available. \\nIn the United Kingdom, there is a /f_inal salary pensi on plan.

Employee bene/f_its, continued\\nShare value based incentive programs\\nIn 2015â2018, the Annual General Meeting decided on  performance-based \\npersonnel stock option programs based on a proposal  from the Board on an \\noption program for the respective years. In 2019, t he Annual General Meeting \\ndecided on a performance-based personnel stock opti on program for 2019  \\nsimilar to the 2015â2018 programs. \\nOption programs 2015â2019\\nAt the Annual General Meeting 2015â2019 respectivel y, it was decided to \\nimplement performance-based personnel stock option programs. The decision \\nto grant options was made in April each year and th e options were issued in \\nMarch the following year (issue date). The number o f options issued for each \\nprogram year depended on the value creation in the Group, measured as Eco -\\nnomic Value Added (EVA), for the respective program  year. For the 2019 option \\nprogram, the number of options varies on a linear b asis within a preset EVA \\ninterval. The size of the plan and the limits of th e interval have been established \\nby the Board and have been approved by the Annual G eneral Meeting and are \\ncompatible with the long-term business plan of the Group.\\nIn connection to the issue, the exercise price was calculated as 110% of the \\naverage trading price for series A shares during a ten-day period following the \\ndate of the publishing of the fourth quarter report . The options were issued \\nwithout compensation paid by the employee and the o ptions remain the prop -\\nerty of the employee only to the extent that they a re exercisable at the time \\nemployment is terminated. The 2015 program has a te rm of /f_ive years from the \\ngrant date whereas the 2016â2019 programs have a te rm of seven years. The \\noptions in the 2014â2019 programs are not transfera ble and become exercis -\\nable at 100% three years after grant.\\nThe 2015â2019 programs include a requirement for se nior executives (31 in \\ntotal) to purchase Atlas Copco A shares for 10% of their gross base salary in \\norder to be granted options. A lower amount of inve stment will reduce the \\nnumber of options proportionately. Further, senior executives who have \\ninvested in Atlas Copco A shares will have the opti on to purchase one matching \\nshare per each share purchased at a price equal to 75% of the average trading \\nprice for series A shares during a ten-day period f ollowing the date of the pub -\\nlishing of the fourth quarter report. This right ap plies from three years after \\ngrant until the expiration of the stock option prog ram. \\nThe Board had the right to decide to implement an a lternative incentive solu -\\ntion (SARs) for key persons in such countries where  the grant of personnel \\noptions was not feasible. \\nIn the 2015â2018 programs, the options may, on requ est by an optionee in \\nSweden, be settled by the Company paying cash equal  to the excess of the clos -\\ning price of the shares over the exercise price on the exercise day, less any admin -\\nistrative fees. Due to this choice of settlement by  the Swedish employees, these \\noptions are classi/f_ied for accounting purposes as ca sh-settled in accordance \\nwith IFRS 2.The Black-Scholes model is used to calculate the fa ir value of the options/SARs in \\nthe programs at issue date.

The exposure occurs in r elation to payments in for -\\neign currency (transaction exposure) and when trans lating foreign subsidiariesâ \\nbalance sheets and income statements into SEK (tran slation exposure). \\nâ Transaction exposure\\nTransaction exposure risk is the risk that pro/f_itabi lity is negatively a/uniFB00ected by \\nchanges in exchange rates, a/uniFB00ecting cash /f_lows in fo reign currencies in the \\noperations. Due to the Groupâs global presence, the re are in/f_lows and out/f_lows \\nin di/uniFB00erent currencies. As a normal part of busines s, net surpluses or de/f_icits in \\nspeci/f_ic currencies emerge. The values of these net positions /f_luctuate subject to \\nchanges in currency rates and, thus, render transac tion exposure for the Group.  \\nPolicy\\nThe Groupâs policy states that exposure shall be re duced by matching in and \\nout/f_lows of the same currencies. Business area and d ivisional management are \\nresponsible for maintaining readiness to adjust the ir operations (price and cost) \\nto compensate for adverse currency movements. Based  on the assumption that \\nhedging does not have any signi/f_icant e/uniFB00ect on the G roupâs long-term result, \\nthe policy recommends to leave transaction exposure s unhedged on an ongo -\\ning basis. In general, business areas and divisions  shall not hedge currency risks. \\nThe Financial Risk Management Committee can decide to hedge part of the \\ntransaction exposure. Transactions shall then quali fy for hedge accounting in \\naccordance with IFRS and hedging beyond 18 months i s not allowed. Financial \\ntransaction exposure is fully hedged. \\nStatus at year end\\nThe Group has continued to manage transaction expos ures primarily by match -\\ning in- and out/f_lows in the same currencies. Graph 1  shows the net of in- and \\nout/f_lows per currency for currencies which have the largest surplus or de/f_icit. \\nThe operational transaction exposure is de/f_ined as t he net operational cash \\n/f_low exposure and amounts to MSEK  â4 711(â4 670). The estimated amounts \\nare based on the Groupâs operational external payme nts from customers and to \\nsuppliers. \\nThe transaction exposure sensitivity analysis is ba sed on the operational \\ntransaction exposure. It shows how the cash /f_low and  pro/f_it before tax would \\ntheoretically be impacted by a /f_ive percentage point  change in SEK, USD or EUR, \\nagainst all other currencies. The analysis is based  on the assumption that no \\nhedging transaction has been undertaken and is done  before any impact of  \\no/uniFB00setting price adjustments or similar measures.As an example, the net transaction exposure of in-a nd out/f_low payments in EUR \\nis a de/f_icit as shown in graph 1. A strengthening in  the EUR currency rate against \\nall other currencies with +5% would have a negative  impact on the cash /f_low \\nand pro/f_it before tax of MSEK â438, and a weakening would have a positive \\nimpact of MSEK 438 . \\nTransaction exposure sensitivity 2019  2018 \\nSEK exchange rate + 5% â236 â234 \\nUSD exchange rate + 5% 675 670 \\nEUR exchange rate + 5% â438 â395 \\nOutstanding derivative \\ninstruments related to  \\ntransaction exposure 2019    \\nNominal amount, net in \\ntransaction currency2018    \\nNominal amount, net in \\ntransaction currency\\nForeign exchange forwards     \\nEUR 0 2 \\nGBP 137 88 \\nJPY â 20\\nNOK â  â18 \\nUSD â175  â113 \\nThe Financial Risk Management Committee has decided  to hedge part of the \\ntransaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts.

Each business un it is required to have  \\nan approved commercial risk policy.\\nProvision for credit risks\\nThe business units establish provisions for their e xpected credit losses in respect \\nof trade and other receivables. The IFRS 9 expected  credit loss (ECL) model is for -\\nward looking and a loss allowance is recognized whe n there is an exposure to \\ncredit risk. For assets such as trade receivables, lease receivables, contract assets \\nand certain other /f_inancial receivables, the simpli/f_i ed model is applied. The main \\ncomponent of this provision are speci/f_ic loss provis ions corresponding to indi -\\nvidually signi/f_icant exposures as well as historical  loss rates in combination with \\nforward looking considerations. Lease receivables, certain other /f_inancial \\nreceivables and cash and cash equivalents are impai red by a rating method, \\nwhere ECL is measured by the product of the probabi lity of default, loss given \\ndefault, and exposure at default.

The Group \\nis directly and indirectly exposed to raw material price /f_luctuations. Cost \\nincreases for raw materials and components often co incide with strong \\nend-customer demand and are compensated for by incr eased market prices. \\nTherefore, the Group does not hedge commodity-price  risks.\\nâ Fair value of /f_inancial instruments\\nIn Atlas Copcoâs balance sheet, /f_inancial instrument s are carried at fair value or \\nat amortized cost. The fair value is established ac cording to a fair value hierarchy. \\nThe hierarchy levels should re/f_lect the extent to wh ich fair value is based on \\nobservable market data or own assumptions. Below is  a description of each level \\nand valuation methods used for each /f_inancial instru ment. \\nLevel 1\\nIn the Level 1 method, fair value is based on quote d (unadjusted) prices in active \\nmarkets for identical assets or liabilities. A mark et is considered as active if \\nquoted prices from an exchange, broker, industry gr oup, pricing service, or \\nsupervisory body are readily and regularly availabl e and those prices represent \\nactual and regularly occurring market transactions at armâs length. \\nLevel 2\\nIn the Level 2 method, fair value is based on model s that utilize observable data \\nfor the asset or liability other than the quoted pr ices included within Level 1 that \\nare observable for the asset or liability, either d irectly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly \\n(i.e. derived from prices). Such observable data ma y be market interest rates and \\nyield curves. \\nLevel 3\\nIn the Level 3 method, fair value is based on a val uation model, whereby signi/f_i -\\ncant input is based on unobservable market data. \\nValuation methods\\nDerivatives\\nFair values of forward exchange contracts are calcu lated based on pre vailing \\nmarkets. Interest rate swaps are valued based on ma rket rates and present value \\nof future cash /f_lows. Discounted cash /f_low models are  used for the valuation.\\nInterest-bearing liabilities\\nFair values are calculated based on market rates an d present value of future  \\ncash /f_lows.\\nFinance leases and other /f_inancial receivables\\nFair values are calculated based on market rates fo r similar contracts and  \\npresent value of future cash /f_lows.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP\\n110 Atlas Copco 201928.

Signi/f_icant accounting principles\\nAtlas Copco AB is the ultimate Parent Company of th e Atlas Copco Group and is \\nheadquartered in Nacka, Sweden. Its operations incl ude administrative func -\\ntions, holding company functions as well as parts o f Atlas Copco Financial Solu -\\ntions (Treasury).  \\nThe /f_inancial statements of Atlas Copco AB have been  prepared in accordance \\nwith the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the recomm endation RFR 2, \\nâAccounting for Legal Entitiesâ, hereafter referred  to as âRFR 2â, issued by the \\nSwedish Financial Reporting Board. In accordance wi th RFR 2, parent companies \\nthat issue consolidated /f_inancial statements according to International  Financial \\nReporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the Euro pean Union, shall present \\ntheir /f_inancial statements in accordance with IFRS, to the extent these account -\\ning principles comply with the Swedish Annual Accou nts Act and may use \\nexemptions from IFRS provided by RFR 2 due to Swedi sh accounting or tax legis -\\nlation. \\nThe /f_inancial statements are presented in Swedish kr ona (SEK), rounded to \\nthe nearest million. The parent companyâs accountin g principles have been con -\\nsistently applied to all periods presented unless o therwise stated. The /f_inancial \\nstatements are prepared using the same accounting p rinciples as described in \\nnote 1 in the Groupâs consolidated /f_inancial stateme nts, except for those dis -\\nclosed in the following sections.\\nFor discussion regarding accounting estimates and j udgments, see page 74.\\nSubsidiaries\\nParticipations in subsidiaries are accounted for by  the Parent Company at histor -\\nical cost. The carrying amounts of participations i n subsidiaries are reviewed for \\nimpairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of  Assets. See the Groupâs \\naccounting policies, Impairment of /f_inancial assets,  for further details.\\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with a bus iness combination are \\naccounted for by the Parent Company as part of the acquisition costs and are \\nnot expensed.\\nLease contracts\\nAll lease contracts entered into by the Parent Comp any are expensed \\ncontinously on a stright-line basis over the lease term. Leases are not carried as \\nassets, since the risk and rewards associated with ownership of the assets have \\nnot been transferred to the Parent Company.\\nEmployee bene/f_its \\nDe/f_ined bene/f_it plans\\nDe/f_ined bene/f_it plans are not accounted for in accord ance with IAS 19. In  \\nthe Parent Company de/f_ined bene/f_it plans are accounte d for according to the \\nSwedish law regarding pensions, âTryggandelagenâ an d regulations issued by \\nthe Swedish Financial Supervisory Board. The primar y di/uniFB00erences as compared \\nto IAS 19 are the way discount rates are /f_ixed, that  the calculation of de/f_ined \\nbene/f_it obligations is based on current salary level s, without consideration of \\nfuture salary increases and that all actuarial gain s and losses are included in \\npro/f_it or loss as they occur. \\nShare-based payments\\nThe share-based payments that the Parent Company ha s granted to employees \\nin the Parent Company are accounted for using the s ame principle as described \\nin note 1 in the Groupâs consolidated /f_inancial stat ements. \\nThe share-based payments that the Parent Company ha s granted to employ -\\nees in subsidiaries are not accounted for as an emp loyee expense in the Parent \\nCompany, but are recognized against Shares in Group  companies. This vesting \\ncost is accrued over the same period as in the Grou p and with a corresponding \\nincrease in equity for equity-settled programs and as a change in liabilities for \\ncash-settled programs.Financial guarantees\\nFinancial guarantees issued by the Parent Company f or the bene/f_it of subsidiar -\\nies are not valued according to IFRS 9. They are re ported as contingent liabilities, \\nunless it becomes probable that the guarantees will  lead to payments. In such \\ncase, provisions will be recorded. \\nHedge accounting\\nInterest-bearing liabilities denominated in other c urrencies than SEK, used to \\nhedge currency exposure from investments in shares of foreign subsidiaries are \\nnot translated using the foreign exchange rates on the reporting date, but mea -\\nsured based on the exchange rate the day that the h edging relation was estab -\\nlished. \\nDerivatives used to hedge investments in shares in foreign subsidiaries are \\nrecognized at fair value and changes therein are re cognized in pro/f_it or loss. The \\ncorresponding fair value change on shares in subsid iaries is recognized in pro/f_it \\nor loss, as fair value hedge accounting is applied.\\nGroup and shareholdersâ contributions \\nIn Sweden, Group contributions are deductible for t ax purposes but sharehold -\\nersâ contributions are not. Group contributions are  recognized as appropria -\\ntions in the income statement.

The annual accounts and \\nconsolidated accounts of the company are included o n pages 13â39, 44â48 and \\n51â125 in this document.\\nIn our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepa red in accordance with \\nthe Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the /f_inancial \\nposition of the parent company as of December 31, 2 019 and its /f_inancial perfor -\\nmance and cash /f_low for the year then ended in accor dance with the Annual \\nAccounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been p repared in accordance \\nwith the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in  all material respects, the \\n/f_inancial position of the group as of December 31, 2 019 and its /f_inancial perfor -\\nmance and cash /f_low for the year then ended in accor dance with International \\nFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by  the EU, and the Annual \\nAccounts Act. Our opinions do not cover the corpora te governance statement \\non pages 51â61. The statutory administration report  is consistent with the other \\nparts of the annual accounts and consolidated accou nts.\\nWe therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts \\nthe income statement and balance sheet for the pare nt company and the \\ngroup. \\nOur opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated \\naccounts are consistent with the content of the add itional report that has been \\nsubmitted to the parent companyâs audit committee i n accordance with the \\nAudit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Internati onal Standards on Audit -\\ning (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards  in Sweden. Our responsibil -\\nities under those standards are further described i n the Auditorâs Responsibili -\\nties section. We are independent of the parent comp any and the group in accor -\\ndance with professional ethics for accountants in S weden and have otherwise \\nful/f_illed our ethical responsibilities in accordance  with these requirements. This \\nincludes that, based on our best knowledge and beli ef, no prohibited services \\nreferred to in the Auditors Regulation (537/2014) A rticle 5.1 has been provided \\nto the audited company or, where applicable, its pa rent company or its con -\\ntrolled companies in the EU.\\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is su/uniFB03cient and appro -\\npriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\\nKey Audit Matters\\nKey audit matters of the audit are those matters th at, in our professional judg -\\nment, were of most signi/f_icance in our audit of the annual accounts and consoli -\\ndated accounts of the current period. These matters  were addressed in the con -\\ntext of our audit of, and in forming our opinion th ereon, the annual accounts \\nand consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not  provide a separate opinion \\non these matters.\\nRecognition of revenue in the appropriate period\\nThe group generates revenues from product and produ ct related o/uniFB00erings \\nranging from equipment, service and rental to custo mers in multiple geogra -\\nphies. The time of delivery of the di/uniFB00erent o/uniFB00ering s ranges from a speci/f_ic point \\nin time to over several years, and the sales agreem ents may include complex \\nterms such as buy-back commitments, return rights, and a single transaction \\nmay contain separate revenue components such as pro duct delivery, installa -\\ntion and servicing of equipment sold. All these com plexities managed by several \\nhundred subsidiaries require policies and procedure s as well as management \\njudgment to determine the appropriate method and pe riod to properly recog -\\nnize revenues.\\nIn note 1 the groupâs revenue recognition policy to gether with critical \\naccounting estimates and judgments is described, an d note 4 provides disclo -\\nsures of revenues separated on di/uniFB00erent product o/uniFB00e rings and geographies.To the annual general meeting of the shareholders o f Atlas Copco AB\\nCorporate identity number 556014-2720\\nOur audit procedures\\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited  to:\\nâ¢ assessing the groupâs accounting policy for reven ue recognition and its  \\ncompliance with IFRS,\\nâ¢ analytical review of revenues disaggregated on di /uniFB00erent product o/uniFB00erings \\nand geographies, and\\nâ¢ on a sample basis testing of sales transaction fo r revenue recognition in the \\nappropriate period.\\nValuation of trade receivables\\nThe group has signi/f_icant amounts of trade receivabl es from its sales to custom -\\ners in around 180 countries. There is a risk that p arts of the receivables will not \\nbe paid. The risk may be higher in some geographies  due to weaker economic \\nconditions or geopolitical uncertainties.

The interpretations made  by man -\\nagement may be challenged by di/uniFB00erent tax authoriti es, other authorities and \\ncourts. The groupâs geographical footprint also req uires adherence to tax legis -\\nlation and transfer pricing requirements in many di /uniFB00erent countries.\\nIn note 1 the groupâs accounting policy for income taxes together with critical \\naccounting estimates and judgments is described, an d note 9 provides disclo -\\nsures of income taxes.\\nOur audit procedures\\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited  to:\\nâ¢ review of tax calculations to assess if the incom e tax expense and tax assets \\nand liabilities have been appropriately accounted f or, and\\nâ¢ assessing managementâs processes for monitoring c ompliance with  \\nincome tax legislation and transfer pricing require ments in the di/uniFB00erent \\ngeographies.Atlas Copco 2019 127Audit report, continued\\nAccounting for business combinations and valuation of associated  \\ngoodwill and intangible assets\\nIn 2019 the group completed 18 acquisitions for a t otal consideration of 7 717 \\nMSEK. Accounting for business combinations requires signi/f_icant judgme nts \\nand estimates by management to identify and separat ely recognize acquired \\nassets and assumed liabilities, and to determine ac quisition date fair value of \\nacquired assets and assumed liabilities.

External initiatives and membership of associations\\nAtlas Copcoâs central guiding policy, the Business Code of Practice, supports the \\nUnited Nations International Bill of Human Rights, The International Lab our \\nOrganization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and \\nThe OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. \\nAtlas Copco is a signatory to the UN Global Compact  since 2008, a strategic \\npolicy initiative for businesses that are committed  to aligning their operations \\nand strategies with ten universally accepted princi ples in the areas of human \\nrights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. \\nAtlas Copco is a member of the Swedish Leadership f or Sustainable Develop -\\nment, a business network for accelerating the imple mentation of the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals, coordinated by the Swedish International Develo pment \\nCooperation Agency. \\nAtlas Copco is also active in a number of internati onal organizations and \\nindustry collaborations and initiatives, among them  the Stockholm Chamber of \\nCommerce, the International Council of Swedish Indu stry, Transparency Interna -\\ntional Sweden, the Association of Swedish Engineeri ng Industries, the European \\nCommittee of Manufacturers of Compressors, Vacuum T echnology, Pneumatic \\nTools, Air Treatment Equipment and Condensate Treatment Equipment and  the \\nResponsible Minerals Initiative.132 Atlas Copco 2019SUSTAINABILITY NOTES\\nECONOMIC IMPACT \\nEconomic performance\\nDirect economic value generated and distributed \\nAtlas Copco creates employment and /f_inancial stabili ty through subcontracting \\nmanufacturing and other activities. In 2019, operat ing costs including costs to \\nsuppliers for goods and services, functional costs deducted for employee wages \\nand bene/f_its amounted to MSEK 56 952 (52/uni00A0557). Emplo yee wages and bene/f_its \\nincreased to MSEK 25/uni00A0220 (22/uni00A0129). The Groupâs prov iders of capital, for example \\nshareholders and creditors, provide funds to /f_inance  the asset base that is used \\nto create economic value. In return, these stakehol ders receive annual dividend \\nand interest. The costs for providers of capital in  cluding dividend was MSEK \\n8/uni00A0149 (9/uni00A0381). \\nAtlas Copco contributes to economic development wit hin the regions where \\nit operates, through payments to pension funds and social security, and payments \\nof taxes, social costs and other duties. The cost f or direct taxes to governments \\nincreased 0.6% to MSEK 4 909 (4/uni00A0876). The Group has  been in dialogue with \\nstakeholders regarding disclosure of taxes by count ry (note 9). Community \\ninvestments amounted to MSEK 22. The economic value  retained amounted to \\nMSEK 9/uni00A0000 (7/uni00A0472).\\nLocal purchasing (non-core) is encouraged in order to generate societal value \\nin the communities where Atlas Copco operates, by c reating job opportunities as \\nwell as generating direct and indirect income. This  is mostly carried out by indi -\\nvidual companies, and also decreases the environmen tal impact from transport.\\nAnti-corruption and anti-competitive behavior\\nAtlas Copco has zero tolerance against corruption. The Business Code of Practice \\nis the Groupâs central policy document, accessible to all employees in the internal \\ndatabase. All employees are required to sign the co mpliance statement for \\nadherence to the Business Code of Practice, and tak e online trainings annually. \\nDivision presidents have the ultimate responsibilit y for adherence to the values \\nand policies of the Group. Internal control is exer cised through distribution of \\nresponsibility and internal audits. The compliance board oversees compliance \\nwith the Business Code of Practice.\\nGrievance mechanism\\nA new misconduct reporting system handled by a thir d-party organization, was \\nimplemented at the turn of the year 2019/2020 repla cing the previous system. \\nThe system o/uniFB00ers reporting oppurtunities in all Gro up languages and is accessi -\\nble 24/7. It can be used by employees or other stak eholders to report behavior \\nor actions that are, or may be perceived as, violat ions of laws or of the Business \\nCode of Practice. The Group legal department handle s and documents cases. \\nThe Group is positive to receiving reports through the system since it provides \\nthe possibility to act in such cases.\\nReported potential violations, number 2019\\nFraud 8\\nLabor relations, including discrimination and haras sment 54\\nCorruption 6\\nOther 0\\nTotal 68\\n11 cases are still being investigated, whereof 3 ar e related to fraud, 2 to corrup -\\ntion, 5 to labor relations and 1 to harassment. In 13 cases there were no evidence \\nof wrongdoing, in 17 cases there were no wrongdoing , in 9 cases the investiga -\\ntion led to some form of consequence for the person  responsible for the wrong -\\ndoing. In 17 cases the internal process has been ch anged. 1 case was in court. \\nThere were no signi/f_icant /f_ines or non-monetary sanct ions for non-competi -\\ntive behavior or for non-compliance with laws and/o r regulations in the social \\nand economic area during the year.ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT \\nAtlas Copco has integrated the most material enviro nmental KPIs into its strategic \\nwork. The KPIs drive improvement and e/uniFB03ciency, whil e reducing the Groupâs \\nimpact on the environment. \\nEnvironmental performance is monitored and reported  on unit level and \\naggregated to Group level. General managers are res ponsible for overseeing \\nthe implementation of divisional strategies and goa ls, including undertaking \\ninitiatives to curb energy use and emissions as wel l as to increase the proportion \\nof renewable energy used.\\nEnvironmental management systems\\nTo help minimize the environmental impact and to se cure that the precautionary \\napproach is applied, Atlas Copco has the ambition t o implement environmental \\nmanagement systems in all operations. All product c ompanies should be certi -\\n/f_ied according to ISO 14001 in order to manage and r educe their environmental \\nimpact. Acquired product companies are normally cer ti/f_ied within a two-year \\nperiod. \\nAtlas Copco strives for all major operating units t o be triple-certi/f_ied accord -\\ning to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001/ISO 4500 1. All production units \\nwith more than ten employees and all customer compa nies and rental compa -\\nnies with more than 70 employees are to be triple-c erti/f_ied. By the end of 2019 \\nthe share of required units not being triple-certi/f_i ed constituted 7% of the total \\nnumber of operational units. The same measure for e ach individual certi/f_ication \\nis 4% for ISO 9001, 6% for ISO 14001 and 7% for OHS AS 18001/ISO 45001. \\nThese units are mainly acquisitions still within th e two-year timeframe to comply, \\nor newly restructured units. Some units not yet tri ple-certi/f_ied are in the process \\nof becoming so, and a smaller portion has lacked th e resources so far to commit \\nto a triple certi/f_ication.\\nAtlas Copco requires direct signi/f_icant suppliers to  have a precautionary \\napproach and to have an environmental management sy stem. As of 2019, there \\nis a Group KPI measuring this approach and the ambi tion is that a growing num -\\nber of signi/f_icant direct suppliers should have an a pproved environmental man -\\nagement system. The de/f_inition is an environmental m anagement system that \\nful/f_ills the ISO14001 requirements, which can be con /f_irmed by one of the two \\napproaches below: \\nâ   The supplier is third-party certi/f_ied according to ISO 14001 and holds  \\na valid certi/f_icate. \\nâ   The supplier has been audited on-site by Atlas Copco in the last /f_ive years \\nensuring that ISO 14001 requirements are met, even though the supplier  \\ndoes not hold certi/f_icate. \\nEnergy consumption within the organization\\nEnergy consumption*, % 2019\\nDirect energy, renewable 0\\nDirect energy, non-renewable 28\\nIndirect energy, renewable (incl. renewable of mix) 41\\nIndirect energy, non-renewable 31\\n*  The calculation of indirect energy, i.e. energy purchased externally by the company, includes \\nelectricity (95%) and district heating (5%) used at  the sites. Atlas Copco does not report \\ncooling or steam separately. The calculation of dir ect energy, i.e. energy generated by the \\ncompany for its own production or operation, compri ses all fuels used on the sites, including \\ndiesel, bio-fuel, gasoline, solar, geothermal, prop ane and natural gas. \\nEnvironmental compliance\\nAtlas Copco follows applicable environmental laws i n all countries where the \\nGroup operates. Incidents or /f_ines are reported for non-compliance with envi -\\nronmental legislation, as well as incidents involvi ng chemical, oil or fuel spillages. \\nThere were 0 (1) accident(s) resulting in adverse e nvironmental e/uniFB00ects and there \\nwere no monetary sanctions for non-compliance accor ding to reporting.\\nTwo Swedish companies require permits based on Swed ish environmental \\nregulations. These operations mostly involve machin ing and assembly of com -\\nponents. The permits relate to areas such as emissi ons to water and air, as well as \\nnoise pollution. The Group has been granted 1 permi t needed to conduct its \\nbusiness and 1 was under revision in 2019. Atlas Copco 2019 133SUSTAINABILITY NOTES\\nOccupational health and safety\\nSafety and well-being are key priority areas for At las Copco, and all divisions set \\ntargets and make action plans to enhance awareness and improve behavior, \\npolicies and processes. Group companies shall have an Atlas Copco veri/f_ied \\nSafety Health Environment and Quality management sy stem, which is docu -\\nmented, implemented and maintained on an ongoing ba sis. Customer compa -\\nnies and rental companies with more than 70 employe es and all product com -\\npanies shall be certi/f_ied according to OHSAS 18001/I SO 45001. Continuous \\ne/uniFB00orts are put on behavioral based health and safet y. Safety days have been \\narranged in the Group since 2014.\\nThe safety pyramid\\nIn 2019, the Group started using the safety pyramid  for reporting to support \\nawareness and encourage safe behavior to decrease r isks and ultimately pre -\\nvent injuries in the workforce. Using the pyramid s upports transparent report -\\ning, risk averse behavior and behavior change. The de/f_initions of di/uniFB00erent sever -\\nity of incidents and injuries were changed to align  with international standards. \\nIt is therefore not possible to compare the number and rate of incidents and \\ninjuries with previous years.\\nThe Group KPI for safety-related measures is to hav e a balanced safety pyra -\\nmid. This means that more near misses than minor in juries, and more minor inju -\\nries than recordable injuries are reported. \\nThe results of the 2019 reporting in the safety pyr amid model is described in \\nthe table and in the illustration below. Major haza rds reported for high-conse -\\nquence injuries were road travel, slips and trips, lone working and manual han -\\ndling. Common injuries were for instance cuts from operating machines and \\nsprains from slipping. Actions undertaken to mitiga te hazards were among oth -\\ners defensive driving training, awareness training and risk assessment of working \\nenvironment, inspections, mechanical handling aids and ensuring safe access to \\nequipment. \\nThere was 1 (0) work-related fatality in the Group in 2019. It occurred when \\nan employee in South America was involved in a road  accident on a business trip.\\nHuman rights assessment\\nAtlas Copcoâs central guiding policy is the Busines s Code of Practice. Atlas Copco \\nis also a signatory of the UN Global Compact and is  committed to working with \\nthe ten universally accepted principles in the area s of human rights, labor, envi -\\nronment and anti-corruption. The Business Code of P ractice also supports the \\nInternational Labour Organization Declaration on Fu ndamental Principles and \\nRights at Work, as well as the OECDâs Guidelines fo r Multinational Enterprises. \\nThe Group committed to the UN Guiding Principles fo r Business and Human \\nRights when it was launched in 2011 and works to de velop the implementation \\nof the principles. In accordance with the framework âs requirements, Atlas Copco \\nhas an ongoing process to identify, prevent, mitiga te and account for the \\nhuman rights impacts related to Atlas Copcoâs busin ess and business relations. \\nThe Group strives to work according to the UN Guidi ng Principles across the \\nvalue chain, covering procurement, human resources,  sales, marketing and \\nother business processes. The Groupâs commitment co vers all individuals and \\ngroups who may be impacted by its activities or thr ough its business relation -\\nships. Human rights are monitored by the compliance  board, which has two \\nmembers of Group Management: the SVP general counse l and the SVP Commu -\\nnications and Governmental A/uniFB00airs. The compliance b oard addresses training \\nneeds, impact assessment and the action points rela ted to the implementation \\nof the UN Guiding Principles.

The Group reports th e number of employees  \\nas full time equivalents (FTE) per geographical spr ead and per professional  \\ncategory, as well as divided between white-collar a nd blue-collar employees.  \\n \\nNew employee hires and employee turnover\\nThe total number and rate of external new employee hires in 2019 was 5/uni00A0003  \\n(5/uni00A0506) which constitutes 13.2% (15.3) of the total  average number of employ -\\nees during the year. The percentage of externally r ecruited females was 25% (23). \\nThe total number of resignations was 2 214 (2 380),  which constitutes 5.9% (6.6) \\nof the total average number of employees during the  year.\\nThe Groupâs KPIs for employee satisfaction and enga gement measure \\nemployeesâ perceived opportunities to grow in the c ompany and their percep -\\ntion of the company culture. The goal for both KPIs  are to be above the global \\nbenchmark. The benchmark re/f_lects the employee engag ement survey provid -\\nerâs proprietary benchmark for global companies. Th e benchmark incorporates \\nboth anonymized data from the survey providerâs glo bal customer base with \\ntens of millions of responses across more than 150 countries, as well as data from \\nindustry panel studies to produce robust and unbias ed normative data.\\nFreedom of association and collective bargaining\\nAtlas Copco views trade unions and employee represe ntatives as a necessary \\nand valuable support system for its employees, and fosters relationships based \\non mutual respect and constructive dialogue. As a v oluntary member of the UN \\nGlobal Compact, Atlas Copco ensures that labor prac tices such as the right to \\ncollective bargaining are included in the Business Code of Practice. In 2019, 34% \\n(34) of all employees were covered by collective ba rgaining agreements. \\nAs a decentralized organization, the engagement and  dialogue with labor \\nunions takes place at a local level. In countries w here no independent labor \\nunion exist, Atlas Copco has taken measures to esta blish forums for employer/\\nemployee relations, for example in China, through e nvironment and safety com -\\nmittees. A non-discrimination guideline covers all employees and the Business \\nCode of Practice also covers employee rights.\\nLabor relations are followed-up regularly on the op erational level and \\nreviewed by internal audit. Suppliers in the risk s cope are audited according to \\ncompliance to Atlas Copcoâs Business Code of Practi ce based on international \\nguidelines and frameworks such as the UN Global Com pact and the International \\nLabour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Prin ciples and Rights at Work. \\nDiversity and equal opportunity\\nAtlas Copcoâs global diversity policy states that e qual opportunity should apply \\nwhether Atlas Copco has the role of employer, suppl ier, business partner or cus -\\ntomer. Atlas Copco companies establish local divers ity policies and guidelines in \\nalignment with the Group policy, local laws and reg ulations, and local ambitions. \\nIn 2019, Atlas Copco established the Diversity and Inclusion Council chaired by \\nPresident and CEO Mats RahmstrÃ¶m. The council consi sts of representatives from \\nall business areas, along with the corporate commun ications, human resources \\nand accounting and controlling functions. The counc il meets regularly to follow \\nup on action plans and results in the operations. \\nThe Group strives to increase the share of women in  the organization, and has \\nestablished a KPI measuring the progress. The goal is that by 2030, there should \\nbe 30% women in the Group. Anti-harassment and non- discrimination are \\naddressed in the Business Code of Practice training  that all employees take yearly.\\nAtlas Copco has managers on international assignmen ts coming from 46 \\ncountries and working in 45. In 2019, a total of 72 % (70%) of all senior managers \\nwere locally employed. 44 nationalities are represe nted among the 450 most \\nsenior managers worldwide.

Atlas Copcoâs tax policy can \\nbe found at the corporate website. See note 9 of th e consolidated /f_inancial \\nstatements for the details of taxes paid, reported according to the international \\n/f_inancial reporting standards.\\nDisclosing tax by country\\nAtlas Copco has been in dialogue with investors, NG Os and peers regarding dis -\\nclosure of tax paid per country. At present, there is no established international \\nstandard for reporting taxes paid by country and th e resulting data is therefore \\nnot comparable between di/uniFB00erent companies.

In 2019, one business partner was rejected due to \\nenvironmental, health & safety issues, no business partner was rejected due to corruption \\nin 2019. \\nDe/f_inition of signi/f_icant supplier\\nAtlas Copcoâs de/f_inition of signi/f_icant suppliers are  all external suppliers of \\ngoods and services, direct and indirect, with a pur chasing value above a set \\nthreshold, based on 12-month values from October pr evious year to September \\ncurrent year. For suppliers in countries with a hei ghtened risk for human rights \\nviolations, environmental risks or corruption etc.,  the purchasing threshold is \\nlower (approximately 13% of set value). In 2019, th e number of signi/f_icant sup -\\npliers increased compared with 2018 partly due to i ncrease in business and a \\nreview of the risk country list. \\nResponsible sourcing of con/f_lict minerals \\nResponsible sourcing of minerals is essential to At las Copco and though the \\nGroup does not procure directly from smelters, some  parts of the supply chain \\ndo. To ensure responsible sourcing of minerals, Atl as Copco has a comprehensive \\nprogram to investigate the possible use of con/f_lict minerals included in compo -\\nnents used in Atlas Copco products. \\nAtlas Copco is not in the scope of Dodd-Frank Act, but based on concerns of \\nviolations of human rights, and to support our cust omersâ obligation to the Act, \\nthe Group has measures to detect and prevent the us e of con/f_lict minerals in its \\nsupply chain. In accordance with the upcoming EU co n/f_lict mineral rule EU \\n2017/821 (due to enter into force in January, 2021) , Atlas Copco undertakes due \\ndiligence to ensure its supply chains are not contr ibuting to armed con/f_lict and \\ninstability in the Democratic Republic of Congo and  surrounding countries. \\nAs a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), Atlas Copco \\nadheres to its guidelines by encouraging suppliers to source from smelters veri/f_ied \\nby a third party such as RMIâs Responsible Minerals  Assurance Process, commits \\nto transparency by submitting reporting templates t o customers about smelters \\nin the supply chain and collaborates with stakehold ers. Atlas Copco 2019 135SUSTAINABILITY NOTES\\nEvaluation of distributors\\nAtlas Copco has a large international distributor b ase. Around 20% of revenues \\nare generated via distributors and agents. Atlas Co pcoâs sales strategies are set \\nby the divisions on a global level and are tuned fo r local market needs by the cus -\\ntomer centers. These sales strategies include the c hoice of sales channels and \\ndistributor management. The marketing councils ensu re cross-divisional align -\\nment and develop central policies and tools that im pact all operations. \\nStarting in 2019, the percentage of signi/f_icant dist ributors that sign the Atlas \\nCopco business criteria is a Group KPI covering all  signi/f_icant distributors for the \\nGroup. In 2019, 59% of all signi/f_icant distributors signed the business partner cri -\\nteria (74% of the signi/f_icant distributors were aske d to sign the criteria, and 80% \\nof them did so). Continued e/uniFB00orts will be made to i ncrease this share. \\nDe/f_inition of signi/f_icant distributors: Atlas Copcoâs de/f_inition of signi/f_icant \\ndistributors are all external distributors, includi ng agents and resellers with \\nsales of the Groupâs goods and services for a value  above a set threshold, based \\non 12-month values from October previous year to Se ptember current year. For \\ndistributors, agents and resellers in countries wit h a heightened risk for human \\nrights violations, environmental risks or corruption et c., the sales threshold is set \\nto include all active distributors.\\nProduct responsibility\\nAtlas Copco follows laws and regulations regarding safety, health and environ -\\nmental aspects, product information and labeling.

Vacuum pump\\nThe measurement criteria for this exercise is the t otal \\nenergy and CO2 reduction resulting from the use of the \\nnew product where the saving is achieved by using \\nfewer pumps per chamber for the same performance. \\nThe number of new pumps sold each year since the \\nlaunch is used to calculate the total cumulative ru n \\nhours of the new product in the /f_ield, and hence the  \\nenergy saved compared to continuing to use the old \\nproducts for the application.\\n \\nElectric portable compressor\\nThe CO2 savings is obtained by calculating the emissions \\nfrom a diesel-driven XATS138 and subtracting the ca l-\\nculated emissions from an electricity-driven H250VS D \\nwhich replaces it for the same average usage: 750 h ours \\nper year and an air consumption at 75% of the maxi -\\nmum. One XATS138 consumes 6.7 m/uni00B3 of diesel this way , \\ntranslating to 18 metric tonnes of CO2 in one year. In \\ncomparison, one H250VSD compressor consumes \\n23/uni00A0065 kWh of electricity under the same conditions .  Multiplying by the average European CO2 intensity for \\npower electricity generation (0.46 kg CO2/kWh, see \\nhttps://www.eumayors.eu/IMG/pdf/technical_\\nannex_en.pdf) gives 10.6 metric tonnes of CO2 per year. \\nEnergy savings are calculated based on the H250VSD \\nenergy consumption in relation to a corresponding  \\nreference consumption for the previous diesel model .\\nBattery drill \\nThe comparison was made by measuring the electricit y \\nrequired to fully charge a battery and drill holes in alu -\\nminum till it is fully discharged. The amount of co m-\\npressed air needed to drill the same number of hole s \\nwith a pneumatic tool have been calculated and con -\\nverted in electric energy to drive a compressor. Th is \\nresulted in about 48.7 mWh per drilled hole with th e \\nbattery technology and about 704 mWh per drilled \\nhole with the pneumatic technology. The result \\nshowed that EBB26 requires about 93% less energy pe r \\ndrilled hole in this case.Calculations of product energy e/uniFB03ciency on pages 22 â33136 Atlas Copco 2019SUSTAINABILITY NOTES\\nAtlas Copco has prepared its sustainability report in accordance with the \\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines since 2001.
