NRG YEAR IN REVIEW    I    2022 INTRODUCTION 9 8INTRODUCTION       CUSTOMERS       PEOPLE & PURPOSE       ENVIRONMENT      GOVERNANCE       APPENDIXOur dedication to people extends into the 
communities where we work and live. Last 
year, we donated over $6.5 million to charitable 
organizations, and our passionate employees 
rolled up their sleeves to log 14,000 volunteer 
hours across the United States and Canada. 
And our hard work paid off: we were recognized 
as a top employer for Latino Leaders , one of 
America’s Most R esponsible Companies , and 
a Champion of Board Diversity . 
Continuing our path to net-zero, our 
commitment to responsibly navigating the 
energy transition remains strong. Last year , we 
retired or sold roughly 1,400 MW of fossil fuel-
fired assets as part of our ongoing portfolio 
optimization. While the journey is not always 
linear, we have achieved a 42% reduction in 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since our 
2014 base year. In 2022, less than five percent 
of our consolidated revenues were derived from 
coal-fired assets, a significant change from a 
few years ago. We now turn to our customers 
with behind-the-meter technologies that will 
help reduce their costs and environmental 
footprint – while giving them increased 
resilience and flexibility. 
Today, the energy industry has reached an 
inflection point, and the connected energy 
future is here. Consumers expect simple, 
smart solutions connected through a seamless 
experience. The NRG platform provides just 
that. There was much to be proud of in 2022, 
but our work always continues. The core of NRG 
is strong, and our business is well-positioned for 2023 and beyond. We have a clear vision and 
are taking the road less traveled, forging our In March of 2023, we completed the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, 
accelerating the realization of our consumer-focuse d growth strategy 
and creating a leading essential home services plat form fueled by 
unparalleled insights, proprietary technologies, an d complementary 
sales channels.
In short, we are focused on: 
• Serving the energy needs of end-use customers and wholesale 
counterparties in competitive markets through multi ple brands 
and channels
• Expanding our customer offerings to include products and services 
to protect and intelligently manage the home
• Offering a variety of energy products and services that are 
differentiated by innovative features, premium service, sustainability, 
and loyalty/afÏnity programs 
• Excellence in safety and operating performance of  our power 
generation assets 
• Optimal hedging across our integrated portfolio
• Engaging in disciplined and transparent capital a llocationEssentials for the home and beyond
With our customers’ needs and aspirations at the 
forefront, we are bringing peace of mind, customiza tion, 
and convenience to the home. Our leading brands and 
customer experience as an energy provider have pave d 
the way for trusted relationships inside the home, and 
today, we are much more than simply a power and nat ural 
gas retailer. We are empowering consumers with a unique 
platform that combines innovative energy services a nd 
control with home automation, smart devices,  
and protection.

Sustainability at NRG
Alongside our power values, our sustainability fram ework is a cornerstone 
to the development and evolution of our business. Our approach includes 
five key pillars that help embed sustainability into our organizational culture 
and ensure the long-term reliability, competitivene ss, and success of NRG.

Our pillars drive our collective efforts to provide optimal energy solutions, leverage cleaner 
energy technologies, reduce our carbon footprint, a nd support employee advancement 
through health, safety, and professional growth ini tiatives. 
Sustainable business
This pillar guides our company in the foundational aspects of strong 
sustainability leadership in areas including govern ance, transparency, reporting, 
and stakeholder engagement.
Sustainable customers
A vital component of our sustainability strategy is  providing solutions for our 
customers and helping to lead the transition to a more sustainable future. Our 
goals are to provide more clean energy choices in m ore locations, closer to our 
customers, and to understand and help reduce the ov erall environmental and 
societal impacts associated with their energy use.
Sustainable workplace
Having a strong, healthy, and engaged workforce is a core tenet of our success 
in working towards and achieving our goals across the value chain. Our 
commitment includes a focus on safety, employee health, diversity, equity and electricity we provide to our customers. 
Ultimately, I believe that our technology-
agnostic approach to decarbonization will 
ensure that we have access to the lowest 
cost solutions when they are economic at 
scale. In the near-term, we remain committed 
to offering renewable electricity to those 
customers that demand it, and as discussed 
in the Environment chapter, we are pursuing 
renewable PPAs with third party developers so 
we can bring even more renewable electricity 
to our customers. Q. Looking back on sustainability at NR G in 2022, 
what were some highlights?
A.  In 2022, we:
• Continued our commitment to transparency 
through our 7th annual reporting of IFRS 
metrics1, 2nd annual report on the climate 
positions of our disclosed membership 
organizations, and 4th annual public policy and 
political contributions disclosure. 
• Provided both 2022 data and additional years 
of historical data for certain metrics in our 
sustainability data file, enabling trend analysis 
over a longer time horizon. 
• Incorporated our 13th year of sustainability 
reporting into this broader Y ear-in-Review 
format that includes corporate strategy and 
highlights the tight link between it and our 
sustainability strategy.
We also strengthened our GHG emissions data 
gathering, methodology documentation, and 
reporting processes and controls. I am very 
pleased with both the outcome of that effort – 
more robust processes and controls – and F tigh71 in k 71r 31 ( onet link bet) 10 ( w) 15 ( een it and our ) ] TJ clo.nd our

Consumers should be able to choose their 
electricity and natural gas providers. Competition 
promotes a customer-centric approach to 
business and drives companies to innovate and 
develop products and solutions. Innovation and technologies 
Retail innovation-focused policies improve 
consumer experiences by spurring the 
development of innovative technologies,  
products, and services. Sustainability and lower carbon  
intensity energy 
Competitive markets allow energy providers 
to cater to consumers who would like to 
support renewable electricity from wind and 
solar resources, lower the carbon footprint of 
the natural gas they consume, and  meet their 
energy efÏciency goals.R esilience and reliability 
Retail energy-focused policies help ensure 
customers have access to energy when they need 
it most, helping support a market system where 
reliability and resiliency are prioritized.

Data, technology, and security play a major role in  our 
business. We have the data to make informed decisio ns, the 
technology to support business execution and optimi zation, 
and internal security controls based on the U.S. National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology  (NIST) Cybersecurity 
Framework. In 2022, NRG had no material cyber security 
incidents. The unique power of harnessing data, technology, 
and security keeps us on the cutting edge of our bu siness, 
allowing us to  deliver excellence.
NRG’s unique approach groups data and technology under the same roof. 
Through this combination, we are building enterpris e-wide platforms to capture 
individual consumer insights and behavioral trends that enable us to continue 
innovating and enhancing customer engagement and sa tisfaction with our 
products and services. 
As part of our work we:
• Implemented NRG’s first customer data platform providing industry-leading 
insights and enabling real time personalization
• Built a central data marketplace, opening employee access to governed 
dashboards and data that are relevant to their day- to-day work
• Provided ongoing employee cybersecurity training, conducted quarterly 
employee phishing simulations, tested incident resp onse procedures, and 
identified and remediated information security risks and vulnerabilities

The path to one and a half
Our goals encompass Scope 1, Scope 2, and the employee business travel portion of 
Scope 3, and our base year is 2014. 
T o ensure consistency and relevance, our base year GHG emissions are reviewed 
annually and recalculated as warranted to reflect any changes to our generation asset 
portfolio. Such recalculations are made according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol:  
A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, 2004.
We are proud to be the first power company in North America to 
have our climate goals validated by SBTi as 1.5°C-aligned, the most 
ambitious designation available when our goals were  validated in 
March 20211.
T oday, our 2025 climate goal is characterized as 1.5°C-aligned and our 2050 goal is 
characterized as “committed” according to SBTi’s October 2021 Corporate Net-Zero 
Standard. At present, we are the only North American power company to have these 
designations. 100%

  2020 2021 2022Progress reducing GHG emissions
Since our 2014 base year , our CO2e emissions have decreased 42%, from 
60 million metric tons to 35 million metric tons. T he decrease is attributed to 
reductions in fleet-wide annual net generation and a market-driven shift away 
from coal as a primary fuel to natural gas. The inc rease in emissions in 2022, as 
compared to 2021, was primarily due to increased ge neration driven by power 
market conditions and weather. We are continuing to  target a 50% reduction 
in GHG emissions by 2025, however , assuming no mitigating events occur , 
current power market forecasts suggest that the pro jected reduction in NRG’s 
GHG emissions at that time will be less than the targeted goal. Given recent 
and expected future changes in regulatory policies and prices in electricity and 
natural gas markets, we anticipate that these forec asts will continue to evolve 
over time, and we are actively monitoring and explo ring various options to 
achieve our 2025 goal when both economically and le gally feasible.

Knowing that our customers increasingly want sustai nable energy solutions, we partner with 
developers to bring new renewables to the grid thro ugh medium- and long-term renewable PPAs.  
At the end of 2022, NRG had signed agreements for 2 .4 GW of renewable power capacity through 
these PPAs, of which approximately 45% are operatio nal.
When our renewable PPAs come online, the share of r enewables in our total energy supply 
portfolio will rise from 1% to 14%. We expect this share to continue to grow as we retire or   
divest non-core fossil fuel-fired generation assets.
1 These charts represent generation capacity (MW), not actual net generation or total electricity sold (MWh) – see Glossary definitions for Watt

Natural gas is an important part of today’s energy mix and we support its 
continued use as part of a diversified and evolving suite of energy sources. 
We expect that natural gas will become less carbon intense over time through 
advancements in emerging lower carbon and/or methan e forms of gas such 
as renewable natural gas (RNG), producer-certified gas (PCG or simply certified 
gas), and hydrogen.  
Our team delivers reliable, competitively priced natural gas supply and related 
solutions to households, companies, and state and l ocal governments, helping 
them to achieve their climate goals. We also work t o help reduce the carbon 
impact of gas consumption with products like high quality carbon offsets.

Maintaining compliance with our Environmental Manag ement Information 
System (EMIS)
NRG uses an EMIS system called Intelex to track, assign responsibility, and 
report on all associated environmental tasks and requirements, which 
helps us maintain compliance. This system efÏciently captures data about 
our generation fleet’s performance, incident management, audit findings, 
corrective actions, and root cause determinations. We continuously analyze 
this information to identify opportunities for impr ovement.

All active NRG plants have a site-specific Biodiversity Plan that outlines 
practices to limit the local impact of operations i ncluding habitat protection and 
enhancement as well as stakeholder education. Annua lly, each plant chooses, 
designs, and implements one econrgSM project and this work contributes to the 
plant’s environmental key performance indicators (EKPI) score. Our econrgSM 
projects span multiple program areas including biod iversity, climate change, and 
resource reduction, reuse, and recycling.

We are proud of our progress in reducing environmen tal impacts in several key 
areas across our operations.
We carefully measure and track compliance with environmental requirements 
and our own standards using our EKPIs, and report o n these monthly. The EKPIs 
measure leading and lagging indicators such as Notices of Violation (NOVs), 
reportable spills, and compliance with laws, and ar e reported internally to our 
management and Board, and externally here in our annual Year in Review. For 
2022, 100% of our generation fleet met or exceeded their respective targets.
1 Our environmental performance metric counts envir onmental incidents such as reportable spills, 
permit deviations, and receipts of NOV. Fewer incid ents results in a lower, more favorable score. 
The chart shows the company’s EKPI score by year as  a percentage of base year 2014, which is 
indexed to 100%. The score associated with the base  year is updated as the composition of the 
NRG generation fleet changes. In some cases, that has resulted in differences from percentages 
previously reported.

T o effectively operate our power plants, we use fresh, recycled, brackish, 
and ocean water to cool condensers during electrici ty power generation 
and create steam for the turbines that produce elec tricity. 
Water usage, scarcity, quality, and its effects on biodiversity are important 
site-specific considerations. T o conserve fresh water , we use non-potable 
options like brackish and grey water from sewage tr eatment plants and 
leachate collection, and reuse water in plant cooli ng and process systems. 
We have invested in water-saving technologies  
like cooling towers that mitigate effects on aquatic  
life and significantly reduce water consumption at  
generating stations. 
Weather , plant capacity utilization, and plant retirements affect water 
usage. The decreases in freshwater withdrawals and corresponding 
discharges in 2022 are due to decommissioning the W aukegan and Will 
County power plants and due to less rainfall in cer tain regions in Texas.

A Notice of Violation2 (NOV) can 
be issued for any violation of law, 
regulation, permit, certification, or 
license, regardless of significance 
and may or may not result in a fine. 
Historically, the vast majority of NOVs 
issued to NRG have not included 
a fine. All NOVs issued to NRG, 
regardless of final disposition, are 
recorded as an incident against  
our EKPI. 
NOVs and spills in 2022
• Three NOVs: one from a 2019 
incident which included a $125,000 
fine and two that did not incur fines
• One reportable oil spill releasing 
approximately 4.8 barrels of oil that 
were contained within the designed 
containment system on  
NRG property
• One unauthorized discharge  
of process water totaling 
approximately 60 barrels that 
discharged from points other  
than the permitted outfall
• No reportable chemical spillsWaste
We work to reduce, reuse, and recycle materials use d in our daily operations 
to help preserve natural resources, save money, and  improve operational 
efÏciency. The scope of our waste management programs includes both 
corporate ofÏces and generation facilities. 
Coal combustion residuals 
In 2022, NRG facilities generated approximately 1,0 35 thousand metric tons of 
CCRs, 80% of which—more than 830 thousand metric tons—were beneficially 
reused. The remainder was disposed in accordance wi th applicable state and 
federal regulations.
CCRs are used in industrial applications like on- and off-plant road construction, 
as well as in materials like cement, gypsum board, and roofing shingles. This 
practice reduces the need for mining virgin resourc es like native soil, gravel,  
and gypsum. NRG has a program for researching beneficial uses for CCRs and 
will continue to use these options to the extent po ssible.
Electronic waste
NRG works with Compucycle to recycle electronic waste (e-waste) such  
as old computers and other electronic products. In 2022, NRG recycled 
22 U.S. or short tons of e-waste. Since 2014, NRG has recycled 505 short  
tons of e-waste.  
1 Baselines have been recalculated to reflect the composition of the NRG generation fleet. In some cases, that has resulted in differences from 
beneficial use percentages from previous reports. Reported numbers for 2020 include material from a cleaned-out bottom ash pond at one facility.

Our Board of Directors is dedicated to maintaining the highest integrity 
for our company, and we are proud of its leadership  and the contributions 
made to the evolution of NRG. T ogether with management, the Board is 
responsible for establishing our operating values a nd code of conduct as 
well as setting our strategic direction and priorities. The Board has adopted 
Corporate Governance Guidelines  that, along with the Amended and 
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, and the Charters of the 
Board Committees, provide the framework for the governance of NRG.
A model for success
We are committed to upholding the highest standards  of corporate governance and have taken 
a proactive approach to applying leading governance  principles and practices.
The Board is comprised primarily of independent directors.1  In 2022, the Board included 11 
directors and was composed of five standing committees: Audit, Compensation, Governance  
and Nominating (G&N), Finance and Risk Management, and Nuclear Oversight.
We are proud to have one of the most diverse Boards in terms of director 
tenure, age, gender , and ethnicity. Of our eleven directors, seven are gender  
or ethnically diverse. 
The G&N Committee of our Board seeks to reflect the gender and ethnic diversity of our people 
and those we serve. In choosing director candidates, our definition of diversity goes beyond race 
and gender and includes valuing a diversity of viewpoints, experience, and tenure. Differences 
in expertise allow the Board to hear various perspectives from its members, leading to better 
outcomes and a robust decision-making process.

At NRG, we care about doing the right thing—all the time and not just when it’s 
convenient. When we demonstrate a commitment to act ing ethically, we earn and 
preserve trust and help to ensure we meet our legal obligations as a company. Our Code

through our decisions and actions. By adhering to the Code, we are living our values and 
ensuring that NRG continues to be recognized for mo deling integrity and ethical behavior 
in all that we do. Each employee is required to take Code of Conduct training annually and 
attest to having completed it and to comply with it .
As well as highlighting potential risks to watch ou t for, our Code helps us maintain a Culture 
of Care in which we can all thrive, providing guida nce with respect to competition and 
fair dealing; confidentiality; conflicts of interest; corporate opportunities; protection and 
proper use of the Company’s assets; recordkeeping; reporting illegal or unethical behavior;

environmental stewardship 
and social responsibility
Board of Directors
Sustainability is a philosophy that underpins and facilitates value creation 
across NRG’s business for all of its stakeholders. It is an integral piece of NRG’s 
strategy and ties directly to business success, red uced risks and enhanced 
reputation. At NRG, we have adopted an integrated g overnance approach 
to the oversight of environmental and sustainabilit y issues, including climate 
change. Our full Board has ultimate responsibility for climate risk oversight as 
a component of the Company’s business strategy. The Board committees are 
then structured to conduct more in-depth reviews of specific sustainability 
issues, with the Governance & Nominating Committee formerly responsible for 
the Company’s sustainability policies and programs.
The rationale for formalizing the governance struct ure for climate and other 
sustainability-related issues is to ensure that the Board and its committees are 
effectively ensuring that all material risks to the company are mitigated and for 
guiding NRG’s pursuit of significant business opportunities.
Sustainability is formally included as an agenda item at a full Board meeting 
and is discussed separately by the G&N Committee at least once per year. In 
addition, sustainability-related matters are also be discussed at other Board 
and Committee meetings as the context requires. 
For example, the Compensation committee regularly discusses ESG 
compensation metrics in the context of annual compe nsation plan design and 
achievement of compensation plan metrics.1

Launched in 2015, the 17 SDGs are a global set of goals, targets, and indicators 
developed by the United Nations to guide countries, communities, and 
organizations in their work to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and 
tackle climate change by 2030. 
While all 17 development goals are important for gl obal sustainability, 
corporations select the SDGs applicable to their business and focus their time 
and resources on those. In our case, these are: 
For more detail regarding our SDG-aligned initiatives, see the full chart . 
Sustainability reporting 
We are committed to leadership in sustainability, t ransparency, and disclosure.  
Disclosure quality, as well as overall sustainability performance, are assessed 
through ongoing stakeholder feedback, including thr ough investor relations 
and engagement in voluntary disclosure organizations such as the CDP, TCFD, 
and SASB, which was recently incorporated into the IFRS Foundation. View our 
comprehensive reporting approach and historical rep orts here.Tying ESG to compensation 
In 2022, NRG began incorporating an ESG metric into its annual cash incentive 
plan, directly linking our executive compensation program to our ESG 
commitments and objectives. Items included in the 2022 ESG metric are 
customer satisfaction, EKPIs, development and commu nication of a carbon 
intensity measure, an emerging leaders development program, diversity 
recruiting practices, and employee well-being. For Named Executive OfÏcers 
(NEOs), the ESG metric has a 15% weight in the determination of annual cash 
incentive plan funding.
Climate opportunity and climate risk 
Each pillar of our sustainability strategy embodies  climate risks and 
opportunities that are continually evolving based o n external developments 
and company strategy and activity. While we current ly face certain climate risks, 
we believe  our strategy is increasing the company’ s resilience to climate risks 
while positioning it to realize climate opportuniti es.
A more in-depth analysis of NRG’s climate risks and  opportunities can be found 
in our 2020 TCFD Report here. 
Environmental stewardship 
As further discussed in the Environmental Management section , we are 
committed to operating in an environmentally respon sible manner and in 
compliance with all applicable environmental requirements. Our Environment-
Over-Production policy sets a clear directive that environmental compliance 
takes precedence over production at NRG. Every empl oyee is empowered to 
take the necessary steps to continuously maintain e nvironmental compliance.

Glossary 
Business R esource Groups (BRGs):  Voluntary, employee-led groups at NRG 
organized around a particular shared background, in terest, or issue.
Carbon intensity of electricity: the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(measured in metric tons) emitted per unit of electricity measured in a variant 
of watt hours (terawatt hours, gigawatt hours, megawatt hours, kilowatt hours). 
See also revenue carbon intensity.
Carbon offset:  Mechanism to compensate for the GHG (carbon dioxide 
equivalent) emissions of a household or larger organization due to its combustion 
of fossil fuels. An example of a carbon offset is afforestation (planting trees).
Community solar:  local solar facilities shared and financially supp orted 
by multiple community subscribers who might not oth erwise be able to 
access solar. 
Demand R esponse (DR):  A program that provides financial incentives to 
end-users to reduce their consumption of electricit y during periods when 
the electricity grid is experiencing high electricity demand (for example when 
temperatures are very high or very low). 
Distributed Energy R esources (DERs):  Modular energy generation and storage 
technologies that provide electric capacity or ener gy where and when it’s 
needed. Usually deployed close to load (at the point of customer demand) and 
behind the customer’s meter, giving customers great er control, predictability, 
and stability when it comes to their energy usage.
Greenhouse gas (GHG):  Traps heat in the atmosphere, resulting in global 
warming and climate change. In the power sector , GHG emissions are released 
during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal , oil, and natural gas, while 
producing electricity. In the natural gas sector , GHG emissions are released 
during the production, transportation, and consumpt ion of natural gas. 
Measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.Power purchase agreement (PPA):  A medium- or long-term contract between 
two parties, one which generates electricity (the seller), and one which is looking 
to purchase electricity (the buyer , either a corporate end-user or a power 
company reselling the electricity to a corporate end-user). PPAs are often used 
in renewable energy, especially solar, as a way for  buyers to access solar electricity 
without having to directly install solar generating capacity onsite. Buyers take 
ownership of the physical energy and receive renewa ble electricity credits.
R evenue carbon intensity:  the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (measured 
in metric tons) per unit of revenue typically measured in a variant of dollars 
(millions of dollars, thousands of dollars).
Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA): A variation of a PPA in which 
the buyer does not take ownership of the physical e nergy generated. Instead, 
a VPPA is a financial transaction whereby a corporate customer agrees to 
purchase power at a negotiated price from a wind or  solar project over a 
predetermined number of years, committing to pay a fixed price to the owner 
of the facility for each unit of electricity produc ed. As with a PPA, the buyer 
receives renewable electricity credits, but the dev eloper takes responsibility for 
managing the delivery and sale of the electricity p roduced on the open market.
Watt (W):  A measure of electricity generation capacity at a particular point in 
time. Variants include kilowatts (kW, thousand watts), megawatts (MW, million 
watts), gigawatts (GW, billion watts), and terawatts (TW, trillion watts).
Watt hours (Wh): A measure of the amount of electricity provided ove r a 
particular period of time (typically one year or one month). 1 Watt hour is equal 
to 1 Watt of average power flow over the course of an hour. Variants include 
kilowatt hours (kWh, thousand-watt hours), megawatt hours (MWh, million 
watt hours), gigawatt hours (GWh, billion watt hours), and terawatt hours (TWh, 
trillion watt hours).BUSINESS

This Y ear in Review is an integrated report of comp any data and sustainability progress. The 
content of this report strives to provide stakehold ers with a comprehensive sustainability 
update, highlighting our commitment to people, the environment, and the governance 
principles that inform our work. To delve deeper in to certain topics, the list below is a catalog 
of the most recent publications spanning our busine ss. 
This list is also posted on NRG’s website  and will be refreshed as additional reports are 
published. We hope this provides an even more compl ete view of NRG. As always, if you do 
not find what you are looking for , please email us at communications@nrg.com .Key issues assessment
NRG strives to report decision-useful information t o our stakeholders in an 
efÏcient and concise manner. We recognize that we have many different 
stakeholder groups which may each require information presented in a 
variety of ways and on numerous topics. We engage p roactively with our 
key stakeholders to understand the type of informat ion that is of greatest 
interest and the processes that will most effectively deliver data to them. 
However , given rapidly growing interest in voluntary sustainability reporting, 
we must also focus on compiling the most relevant i nformation while 
achieving greater transparency. 
As part of the above process, we periodically condu ct a key issues 
assessment to ensure that we identify potential str ategic and operational 
risks and opportunities as well as specific sustainability issues that are 
relevant to our current and potential future busine ss and operating 
environment. The key issues assessment provides a f oundation of topics 
from which to prioritize our sustainability goals a nd initiatives, prepare annual 
sustainability reporting, as well as provide insigh t into emerging issues that 
our stakeholders care about. 
To conduct the key issues assessment, we monitor th e competitive, 
regulatory, and media landscapes. For the purpose of NRG’s Year in Review, 
these findings are also compared with external best practice publications on 
sustainability metrics, such as from the Electric P ower Research Institute, 
TCFD, and SASB / IFRS. We use this independent analysis to better inform 
business decisions and shape our voluntary reporting process. For the 
purposes of sustainability reporting, NRG has consi dered the GRI framework 
to report on issues of importance to the company an d its stakeholders. 
Relevant financial implications, as well as a discussion of risks and 
opportunities associated with some of these issues,  can be found in Part 1, 
Item 1A in our 2022 form 10-K. Additional financial statements or equivalent 
documents can be found  here.

Clarification of percentage covered under emissions-limiting and emissions-re -
porting regulations:
Nearly all (>99%) of NRG’s emission sources are subject to mandatory U.S. federal (Envi -
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA)) greenhouse gas reporting regulations. In addition, 
some of these emission sources (0.6% specified under IF-EU-110a.1(2) above) also 
report to regional and state CO2e reporting programs (RGGI, AB32) that are disclosed 
annually as part of NRG’s financial reporting data.SASB Standards table 
The mission of SASB, now known as The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
Foundation, is to develop sustainability metrics for public corporations to disclose material, 
decision-useful information to investors. NRG suppo rts work that contributes directly to 
providing comparable and consistent data. The natur e of our business directs us to consult the 
SASB Standards for Infrastructure Sector – Electric Utilities & Power Generators  as defined by the 
Sustainable Industry Classification System (SICS). Below is a table which contains those topics 
we have identified as key issues and against which we are able to report as a publicly-traded 
company. Topics that are not applicable to NRG are denoted as such. Activity metrics that may 
assist in the accurate evaluation and comparability  of disclosure may be found in NRG’s 2022 
Form 10-K and in NRG’s 2022 Year-in-Review Report, which now includes NRG’s sustainability 
reporting. Quantitative data may be followed by nar rative information that contextualizes the

Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) 
Emissions 
& Energy 
Resource 
PlanningDiscussion of accounting, estimations and uncertainty for Scope 1 Emissions:
Scope 1 includes only direct GHG emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, 
turbines, and engines used to produce electric power. Scope 1 GHG emissions were 
determined by using methods specified within Title 40, Chapter I, Subchapter C, Part 98, 
Subparts A (Jan. 1, 2018 update), C (Sep. 21, 2018 update), and D (Jan. 3, 2017 update).  
The determination of the equity share of GHG emissions is consistent with equity share 
methodologies for equity share accounting for greenhouse gas emissions as described 
in the GHG Protocol.  
GHG emissions from combustion of fossil fuels used for other activities or equipment, 
such as auxiliary boilers, starter engines, and company fleet vehicles are not included at 
this time as the associated emissions are immaterial. Scope 1 emissions do not include 
emissions from fugitive sources such as hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) releases from use of 
refrigeration and/or air conditioning equipment, sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from electrical 
equipment, and methane releases from natural gas transport as they are not material 
sources of greenhouse gases for the Company.IF-EU-110a.1

by 2025, from the current 2014 baseline, and 
achieve net-zero by 2050. From 2014-2022 
our emissions decreased 42%. 
Disclosure of our strategy to manage Scope

Discussion of accounting, estimations, and uncertainty for Air Emissions:
Data collection varies based on the generation faci lity and may include engineering

* NRG only has SO2 emissions so SO x emissions are equivalent to SO2  emissions.
** The requirement to report PM10 emissions in annual emissions inventories or 
emissions statements varies across states. In addit ion, the earliest reporting deadline 
for a reporting year is July 1st of the following year. For sites in NRG’s fleet that have not 
yet or are not required to report PM10 emissions at the time of submittal to SASB, NRG 
has used the U.S. EPA’s AP-42 emission factors to estimate emissions.  
*** In the case of lead and mercury emissions, volu mes are estimated for some facilities 
due to incomplete data at time of publication.NRG YEAR IN REVIEW    I    2022 APPENDIX 143 142INTRODUCTION       CUSTOMERS       PEOPLE & PURPOSE       ENVIRONMENT      GOVERNANCE       APPENDIX

Discussion of Water Management Risks
NRG’s definition of substantive risk from water is the possibility that an event will occur and 
significantly affect the achievement of NRG’s business goals.  Risk identification and assessment 
process applies to both direct operations and suppl y chain. NRG uses measures, metrics, and 
indicators for water risk assessment leveraging man agement and professional judgment from the 
following perspectives:
  •  Financial impact
      -  Corporate earnings
      -  Capital expenditure on technologies to red uce water consumption and withdrawal
  •  Plant operation
      -  Operation disruption due to shortage
      -  Increase in water cost
      -  Supply chain risk
  •  Environmental impact
      -  Availability
      -  Quality of river basins
      -  Regulations that impact supply and/or mana gement of waterIF-EU-140a.3T opic Accounting Metric SASB Code
Water
ManagementDiscussion of strategies and practices to mitigate risks
Water risk is monitored by the risk owners (individual plant operators) and reported to 
management upon material changes with a threshold o f 20% in water consumption and 
withdrawal levels. If determined that a water suppl y risk exists that could impact projected 
generation levels at any plant within a two-year time frame, risk mitigation efforts are 
identified and economically evaluated for implementation. 
NRG’s Plant Operations team reviews modelling scenarios generated. Plant water usage 
is reviewed annually. Analysis is reviewed by the senior leaders of NRG’s Operations, 
Engineering, and Commercial Operations teams. The WRI Aqueduct tool is used annually 
to develop a high-level view of basin-level risk th at informs strategic decision-making and 
the setting of goals and targets. This tool was cho sen because of its open-source nature 
and ease of use. Each generating facility is unique, and the water risk approach identifies 
and addresses risks for each covering:
• Availability            • Quality                    • Regulatory                • Stakeholders  
 • Financial               • Operational         • Environmental       • Supply chain impacts  
Risk response decisions are primarily made and exec uted by managing plant operations 
to maintain compliance with all regulations.  NRG r eports supply chain water risk annually 
through the CDP Water Security Questionnaire.IF-EU-140a.3

Item 1-A, Risk Factors Related to NRG Energy, Inc., pages 24-37.
Throughout 2022, we continued to engage with policy makers 
in Washington, D.C. and at the state level. We also  maintained 
our relationships with groups such as the Electric Power Supply 
Association and various informal organizations. Whe n possible, 
we collaborate with groups focused on clean energy access 
and climate solutions. Typically, we engage on legi slative and 
regulatory actions designed to mitigate GHG emissions, as well 
as policies that support the development and deploy ment of 
competitive low-carbon power generation technologie s. We are 
most active in the debate aimed at protecting and e xpanding 
competitive power markets and consumer choice, both  of which 
we believe are critical enablers of achieving least -cost low-
carbon outcomes.
This year, we once again evaluated the climate posi tions of 
certain membership organizations, trade association s and social 
welfare organizations to which we pay annual dues.1 In 2022, the 
organizations evaluated were either (i) in alignment with the Paris 
Climate Agreement or (ii) did not have a climate position. Our 
assessment was published in our Industry Association Climate 
R eview  which we update annually.

The National Safety Agency defines near-misses as “an unplanned 
event that did not result in injury, illness, or da mage, but had the 
potential to do so.”  NRG uses an electronic Incident Management 
System to document, communicate, track, and trend specific 
factors about each event including causal factors a nd corrective 
actions; this system provides automated fleet-wide notifications.  
The number of near misses is derived from a report pulled from 
the Incident Management System.  NRG’s Operational Health 
and Safety (OHS) management system applies to 100% of U.S. 
operations. The system also includes notifications to executive 
management when significant safety events occur that meet the 
defined criteria for a Significant Event notification. The system also 
generates weekly reports to communicate any events from the 
previous week to NRG personnel. "

AppendixCorning Incorporated is pleased to present our annu al Sustainability Report. In this report, we 
update our progress against our 1 2 sustainability g oals, which we introduced in 2020 to accelerate 
and focus our efforts to address environmental, soc ial, and governance (ESG) issues. 
The data in this report reflect Corning’s worldwide operations across all reportable business 
segments for calendar year 2021 , unless otherwise n oted. This report has been prepared with 
reference to the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) standards. It also responds to the Hardware 
Sustainability Accounting Standard, the Sustainabil ity Accounting Standards Board (SASB)  
sector‑ specific standard most relevant for our business. This year, we have also aligned 
our disclosures with the Task Force on Climate-Relat ed Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
recommendations as well as relevant United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals  
for which we have the greatest impact. We are commi tted to providing annual updates on our 
sustainability performance and strive to expand our  disclosures in future reports. 
We have noted throughout the report where data has received third-party assurance. More 
information about our sustainability goals can be f ound on page 23. More information about  
how we applied the reporting standards can be found  on pages 74-91 .“For 170 years, we’ve

short of inspirational. Y ou can 
see why we believe Corning’s 
greatest contributions are  
yet to come.""We must position ourselves to 
continue inventing products that help 
deliver benefits to an overwhelming 
percentage of the global population. 
We do that by maintaining deep, 
long-standing relationships with our 
customers. They rely on our expertise 
and unique capabilities, which we 
can only offer by employing and 
retaining the best talent. So, when 
we ask people to join us, we want 
them to spend their entire work lives 
at Corning. We provide our people 
with many different experiences to 
enrich their careers and prosper. By 
extension, we take an active role in the 
communities where we work and live, 
because we want our employees to 
enjoy them, and we want their children 
to stay and join us as well. Finally, given 
our long-term focus, we must always 
be working on discovering the next 
advancement that will power us for 
generations to come. 
Through this lens, we see distinct 
opportunities to continue making 
a positive difference in this era —  
through our products and through 
thoughtful actions involving every 
facet of our day-to-day operations.

CORNING'S STAKEHOLDERS
Few companies have a time‑tested track record of scientific research and innovation that is vital to improving lives and 
making a real difference in the world. Corning is one of those companies. We’ve thrived for 170 years by continually 
finding new ways to help move the world forward.
This approach started in our earliest days, when ou r 
company’s founders committed to scientific innovation in 
glassmaking. Their philosophy was to let other comp anies 
stamp out drinking glasses, bottles, and plate glas s 
windows. Our people would focus on transformative 
technology, such as developing a reliable railroad signal that 
could significantly reduce fatalities by eliminating a primary 
cause of train accidents, or creating the heat-resi stant glass 
sleeve for Thomas Edison’s light bulb — and the process 
that would help bring electric light into every hom e. 
Our cont ribut ions across t hree cent uries speak  
for t hemselves: 
• Our PYREX®  pet ri dishes  enabled the development 
of penicillin, and our Corning glass jars enabled J onas 
Salk to produce the polio vaccine. Today, our techn ology Today, in a world where technology underpins every facet  
of human life, we've positioned ourselves at the center 
of major industry transformations. We’re helping build a 
world of communication and connection — where infinite 
and ubiquitous bandwidth facilitates real-time infor mation 
and on-demand connections; a world where people can 
do more from their mobile device in the palms of their 
hands or even on their wrists; a world in which large , lifelike 
displays provide the window through which we access 
entertainment; a world where cars are autonomous, 
connected, and increasingly green; and a world in which  we 
help facilitate the discovery and delivery of new medicine s 
that are individualized, effective, and safe. 
In total, these contributions reflect our mission: delivering 
inventions that provide value to society. Central to th at 
mission are the positive, symbiotic relationships we 
maintain with a diverse set of stakeholder groups. We 
know our success is about more than what happens with in 
our four walls; to extend Corning’s sustained ability to 
innovate as our primary source of value creation, we req uire 
mutual support and success among our people, partners , 
communities, investors, society, and future stakehold ers. 
In addition to simply being the right thing to do, it  makes 
logical sense that we work to provide value for all our 
stakeholder groups.
Our deep commitment to each group has manifested in 
many forms over time. The nature of the link between our 
actions and their impact on stakeholders is illustrated  in the 
graphic on the previous page. The largest impact we ha ve 
on the world is enabled by our technology Society:  Corning’s greatest potential for improving lives is tied to our products and 
innovations. We apply our core technologies and prop rietary manufacturing and 
engineering platforms to help solve some of society’s most pressing challenges, and 
our positive impact has been demonstrated across th ree centuries. Our success stems 
from an aspiration to moving the world forward in e verything we do. And that extends 
to the implications of our actions, including respe cting and protecting human rights, 
supporting racial justice activities, bolstering co mmunities, improving the environment, 
and protecting our employees.Our Investors:  We’re maintaining an effective value‑creation strategy, which is 
driven by our strong stewardship and leadership pos ition in three highly relevant 
core technical capabilities and four proprietary ma nufacturing and engineering 
platforms. As we find new synergies among them, we unlock disruptive innovations, 
creating vibrant franchises that generate strong cash flow, outperform competitors 
in sales and profits, and lead industries for decades. In turn, we utilize our strong cash 
generation to invest in ongoing growth, extend our leadership, and return cash to 
shareholders in the form of dividends and share rep urchases.

A DISCUSSION WITH OUR VICE PRESIDENT OF  
SUST AINABILITY AND CLIMA TE INITIA TIVES 
MS: Sustainability means balancing the ways we 
serve our stakeholders so they continue to enable, 
and benefit from, our success. As we’ve described in 
this report, we have six categories of stakeholders : our 
people, partners, communities, investors, society, and 
future stakeholders. Each group contributes a part 
of what we need to invent, make, and sell our life-
changing products. In turn, we give back the benefits 
of our actions to those same groups. Sustainability  
for us means making that exchange in ways that allo w 
more and more people to participate in enabling, an d 
enjoying, a cleaner and safer world made possible b y 
glass. 
When I reflect on Corning’s sustainability practice over 
the last 1 7 decades, it inspires me to remember tha t 
hundreds of thousands of people have contributed 
directly and billions of people have benefitted — 
accomplishments that not many companies can 
match. Many factories we’ve built have housed jobs Photo courtesy of Corning  
employee Hung‑I Chao
MS: Relative to business priorities, I’d say our 
engagements with customers are becoming 
significantly more focused on sustainability topics. 
Many of our closest partners have begun to recogniz e 
the opportunities for co-innovation and improving o ur 
combined impact. We are finding ways to reduce the 
embodied carbon in our current products, expanding 
our efforts to design new products with sustainabil ity in 
mind from the start, and unleashing our most powerf ul 
tools —  our research, development & engineering 
capabilities —  to invent whole new categories of 
materials to solve issues like connecting underserv ed 
populations and reducing atmospheric greenhouse 
gases. Working to innovate with our suppliers and 
customers is certainly the broadest-reaching measur e 
we have to enhance global sustainability on both th e 
environmental and social side.
As for day-to-day operations, sustainability awaren ess, 
good governance, and empowered action are 
increasing at all levels of the company. Corning’s Board MS: Two related things: our explicit recognition  
of future stakeholders and the potential of our 
innovation portfolio.
Some people are confused that we list “future 
stakeholders” among our other, more commonly 
encountered, stakeholder groups. I understand why 
it seems odd —  but it is very Corning. For years, o ur 
actions have demonstrated our deep commitment and 
dedication to taking the long view, whether through  
investing nearly twice as much as our peers in R&D or 
HR policies that encourage, and achieve, long careers 
with Corning, or myriad other ways. For example, 
we make significant investments in STEM education 
programs in our communities to ensure we have a 
strong pipeline of future scientists, inventors, an d 
engineers who want to make meaningful change on 
the world through their work. Some of those trade-
offs mean that we take less today to ensure we can 
provide more for our stakeholders tomorrow. That ma y 
seem like common sense —  I suppose it is —  but in t he 
real world of immediate demands and rapid decision 
making, it’s easy to shortchange the power and 
potential of the future. So, I’m glad we have the clear 
reminder that the future must be considered.
The second thing I’ll emphasize is our innovation 
portfolio —  we have innovated to improve the world for 
a long time. I mentioned the railroad signal lamp l enses 
we used to make in the 1 800s. What was innovative 
about them was that they didn’t break when they 
were hot and got hit by cold rain or snow. Signal l amps 
were especially important when operators couldn’t Sust ainabilit y Goals1 Mat erial Issues 2021  Progress

We believe sustainable 
business practices are  
vital —  to society and to  
progress. We’re working to 
develop, implement, and enhance 
business practices that support 
healthier communities. We also believe 
Corning can make singular contributions to 
combat climate change through our products 
and technologies.
Reducing our impact on the planet is our responsibi lity 
as a corporate citizen, especially given the urgenc y of the 
climate crisis. It is also a critical cost-mitigati on strategy as 
energy prices rise and the impacts of climate chang e further 
strain access to natural resources, such as water —  particularly in 
water-scarce regions. Addressing climate risk will help limit our 
exposure to future regulatory risks linked to carbo n emissions. 
And we recognize that customers increasingly seek p roducts that 
contribute to their own sustainability goals. 
IN THIS SECTION:Corning is always searching for ways to reduce ener gy 
and natural resource consumption and minimize waste  at 
every step of our operations —  in our research labs , our 
manufacturing plants, and our offices. 
Our goal is to design and manufacture products 
with less environmental impact throughout their lif e 
cycles —  from concept, design, and material choices  
through sourcing, manufacturing, customer use, and,  
ultimately, end of life. In 2022, Corning Life Scie nces and 
Corning Optical Communications will pilot design-fo r-
sustainability methods to define and embed sustainability 
advancements across the entire product life cycle.
Our approach is guided by our Environmental Policy , which 
outlines our commitment to operate in an environmen tally 
responsible manner while complying with and strivin g 
to exceed all applicable laws, regulations, and com pany 
standards. Our global product development teams 
are responsible for environmental compliance and us e

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS
We continually work to identify and implement new a pproaches to energy-
efficient technologies and energy diversification within our operations. We also 
recognize energy and emissions impacts across our e ntire value chain and work 
with our suppliers and customers to enhance sustain able practices.
We launched our Global Energy Management (GEM) prog ram —  aligned 
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ENERG Y STAR®  Guidelines 
for Energy Management —  in 2006 to create and execu te effective energy 
strategies across our global operations. Since then , the program has grown 
to include energy-conservation teams at every Corni ng manufacturing 
facility around the world. This allows us to look a t our energy and emissions 
management using a holistic approach. 
Understanding and Mitigating Climate Risks and Opportunities  
In 2021, we engaged management‑level personnel across Corning’s five Market‑Access Platforms to understand which 
climate‑related risks were most relevant to their business units. Using this feedback, we identified seven climate‑related 
risks and two climate-related opportunities (see ta ble) and conducted an in-depth scenario analysis to assess their 
potential impact on our business under two different climate scenarios: In 2021 , using guidance developed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) , 
Corning added two more goals to our list of climate  commitments (see page 23): 
For more informat ion on our climat e-relat ed 
ef fort s, see our Task Force on Climat e-Relat ed 
Financial Disclosure (TCFD) report  (page 74).• Reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions by 30%  (absolute basis) by 2028 compared to  
a 2021 baseline. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction 
goal is in alignment with a 1.5°C future scenario.
• Reduce our relevant Scope 3 emissions by 17 .5% 
(absolute basis) by 2028 compared to a 2021  baselin e.  
Our Scope 3 GHG emissions reduction goal is in alignment 
with a well‑below 2°C future scenario.
In 2021 , Corning committed publicly to submitting t hese goals to SBTi. This builds  
on our multiyear effort to address the impact of cl imate change —  efforts, which,  
in some cases, span well over a decade. Our efforts  include:We continually work to identify and implement new a pproaches to energy.  
In 2021, the EP A named Corning an ENERGY ST AR® Partner of the 
Y ear for the eighth consecutive year and recognized us for Sustained 
Excellence for the sixth consecutive year . In addition, six of our global 
manufacturing facilities received the ENERGY STAR®  Challenge for Industry 
recognition by each exceeding the goal of improving energy efficiency by at 
least 10% in five years or less.
These honors recognize not only Corning’s year‑round dedication to energy 
efficiency but also the integral role that the ENERGY ST AR program plays in  
our enterprisewide environmental efforts. 
Global Energy Management (GEM) measures its program  against ENERGY 
ST AR’s 23 Guidelines for Energy Management and encourages all energy  
team members around the world to use ENERGY STAR re sources. We also  
use ENERGY STAR guidelines as a framework to develo p our water and  
waste programs.
Fast-Tracking Renewable Energy  
In 2021, a cross‑Our Sustained Investment in Solar Energy 
2015:  Corning financed a North Carolina solar energy production facility by  
entering into a 25‑year power purchase agreement, which produces approximately  
105,000 megawatt hours of electricity assigned to Corning each year.
2018:  Corning joined Apple, one of our major customers, and nine other Apple suppliers  
to jointly invest $300 million by 2022 in the China Clean Energy Fund. The fund will invest  
in and develop projects totaling more than 1  gigawa tt of renewable energy in China, the  
equivalent of powering nearly 1  million homes.
2019:  We added solar installations to three Corning Life  Sciences facilities: Wujiang, China; Amsterdam, 
Netherlands; and Oneonta, New Y ork, U.S. In total, these solar arrays will help avoid 3.5 million pounds of 
greenhouse gas emissions annually. 
2020:  Corning signed a long-term power purchase agreemen t for our Canton, New Y ork, facility, enabling a 
new off-site solar array to be built within the Riv erview Solar Technology Park in Tonawanda, New Y ork . 
2021:2021 Site Highlights: Energy Efficiency Initiatives
Canton, New Y ork, U.S.:  Corning designed a heat-recovery process to 
reduce gas consumption and emissions of CO₂ and NOx; upgraded boilers 
in administrative areas to high‑efficiency boilers 
Erwin, New Y ork, U.S.:  Corning completed LED lighting retrofits and

From our manufacturing floors to our corporate offices, we're constantly  
working to preserve one of nature's most precious re sources —  water.
Fresh water is vital to our direct manufacturing op erations. While the majority of Corning  
manufacturing facilities use local public water sup ply in their operations, certain  
manufacturing sites require access to industrial wa ter. 
All Corning manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 14001:2015 and use environmental  
management systems to track water withdrawal, disch arges, and consumption, and to identify ways  
to improve water efficiency and quality. We aggregate at the corporate level the volume of all water we 
discharge to municipal sanitary systems to assess y ear-over-year water-use patterns. Individual sites track 
discharges to other destinations and to other disch arge quality, as required by local regulations. Whe re 
possible, we recycle industrial wastewater for use in our manufacturing process.
Corning plans for business growth in the coming yea rs, which could require increased fresh water in ou r direct 
and indirect operations. We are working to offset t his future demand through water-use reduction proje cts in 
our direct operations today, with a focus on manufa cturing plants located in areas of high water stres s. Water Efficiency 
We are committed to data assurance. The last year f or which we have 
assured water data is 2020 (below). We are working to improve our data

Maybe you’ve caught a glimpse of 
them on the highway: Reel after reel 
of Corning optical cable crisscrossing 
the United States bound for Verizon 
locations, as Verizon leverages 
Corning's optical fiber and cable to 
build out its nationwide high-speed 
broadband network. 
Teams at Corning and Verizon 
considered all the reels involved in 
transporting that cable, thought 
of both companies' long-standing 
commitment to sustainability, and 
saw an opportunity: What if the 
companies developed a return-and-
recycle program of wooden shipping 
reels, to eliminate the disposal of 
wooden reels and lessen the need to 
manufacture new ones? 
A Corning optical cable 
manufacturing plant in North

Because I was born in the United States, I have many

Corning’s global health and safety program  
is guided by four principles: 
Full compliance with regulatory 
and corporate health and safety 
requirements, everywhere, all the time
 Continuous identification, prioritization, 
and elimination/mitigation of health and

analyze the health and safety risks 
associated with each task, prioritize 
operational risks, and take proactive 
steps to mitigate each risk until it 
is as low as reasonably achievable. 
After completing an initial inventory 
of all tasks, each operation reviews 
and updates its inventory at  
least annually. 
Each task is analyzed using a formal

In 2021, we received a total of 105 reports alleging 
possible violations of Corning’s Code of Conduct and/
or noncompliance with laws or regulations through 
all of our reporting mechanisms globally, of which 
37 were substantiated with appropriate corrective Anti-Bribery, Anti-Corruption,

To ensure compliance with anti-

Our Approach  
From the sourcing of raw minerals to suppliers’ treatment of their employees, the

All Corning suppliers are expected 
to demonstrate ethical, social, 
and environmental responsibility, 
as outlined in our Supplier Code 
of Conduct and Human Rights 
Policy. Our Supplier Code of 
Conduct embraces the International 
Labour Organization’s Declaration 
on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work. It also requires that 
suppliers comply with environmental 
regulations and reduce their negative 
impacts on the environment. In 2021 , 
we updated our Supplier Code to 
include expanded environmental 
criteria on pollution prevention and 
resource reduction, solid waste, 
air emissions, water management, 
energy consumption, and GHG 
emissions. We also developed a 
Supply Chain Social Responsibility 
eLearning program, which was 
completed by over 300 suppliers.
We gather real-time information on 
relevant supplier activity through 
a supply chain risk management 
platform and use a supply chain 
risk‑profile‑rating solution to assess 
supply chain risk, track events, and 
screen prospective suppliers. We use 
a supply chain incident management 
platform to collaborate across 
Corning to quickly resolve issues.Responsible Sourcing
As a global technology company, Corning manufacture s advanced industrial 
products, some of which contain small amounts of mi neral precursors of 
the metals tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (3TG),  which are found in small 
amounts in many electronic products. Known as conflict minerals, these 
materials may originate from mines in regions where armed conflict is present. 
Corning is committed to the ethical sourcing of the se minerals. We strictly 
prohibit any connection between the materials used in Corning products and 
armed violence or human rights abuse. We expect our  suppliers, and, in turn, 
their suppliers, to do the same. 
Corning enforces this position through our Responsi ble Minerals Policy and 
due-diligence framework, which we broadened in 2021  to include all minerals, 
including cobalt, from conflict‑affected, high‑risk areas. Beyond conflict 
minerals, Corning has an ongoing Responsible Mining  Initiative (RMI) covering 
all minerals with a goal of having 100% of high‑risk suppliers in this area certified 
by independent organizations as socially responsible by 2025. Our definition of 
“high-risk” suppliers includes our Tier 1  suppliers  of mined materials as well as 
their supply networks, which we trace back to the m ine.
To strengthen our ability to rely on only ethical s ources, Corning joined The 
Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) and remains an active 
member of the RMI, a global organization focused on  responsible mineral-Corning has integrated 
environmental-, social-, and 
governance-related risks into 
our risk-management process. 
In doing so, we follow guidance 
provided by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission and the World 
Business Council for Sustainable 
Development. Starting in 2021 , we 
also leveraged the framework of 
the Task Force for Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures to assess 
and report on climate risks and 
opportunities risk for Corning.
We also identify and prioritize 
salient human rights considerations

G1  Describe the 
board’s oversight of 
climate-related risks 
and opportunities.Corning's Board of Directors includes a Corporate Re sponsibility and 
Sustainability Committee (CRASC), whose responsibilit ies include assisting the 
Board in reviewing the company’s management strategies, plans, policies, and 
actions related to our sustainability program and e nvironmental responsibilities. 
This review includes sustainability goals, environm ental and social policies and 
practices, energy and water management strategies, and climate-related risks 
and opportunities, among other focus areas. 
Prior to 2021 , the predecessor committee to CRASC ann ually received two 
principal reports addressing Corning’s climate‑related risks and opportunities:
Corning’s director, Sustainability, presented an update on sustainability, 
including a dashboard indicating the implementation  and performance against 
objectives for all sustainability- and climate-rela ted goals. 
Additionally, the director of Global Environment an d Sustainability, who has 
the responsibility to track and report on greenhous e gas emissions, energy, 
water, and waste, presented an overview of strategi es and actions to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and to enhance Corning’s sustainable impact. Recommended

G2 Describe 
management’s role 
in assessing and 
managing climate-
related risks and 
opportunities.Corning has had two principal managerial oversight bodies for climate change 
issues, including assessing risks and opportunities : the Sustainability Working 
Committee (SWC) and Sustainability Steering Committe e (SSC). Both 
committees are chaired by Corning’s director, Sustainability.
Corning’s SSC comprises executives from multiple functional areas and the 
SSC has the responsibility to sponsor and steer the SWC, including review and 
approval of overall work efforts. The Corning SWC is  a cross-functional and 
cross-organizational committee that meets monthly a nd proposes strategic  and 
tactical sustainability and climate-related work ef forts to the SSC for review 
and approval. The SSC meets quarterly, or more frequ ently as important 
matters arise. The members of the SSC were selected to represent each of  
Corning’s relevant management areas in relation to overall sustainability, which 
includes the assessment of climate-related risks an d opportunities. The positions  
of the SSC members and their climate-related respons ibilities are as follows: 
 •Vice President, Sustainability and Climate Initiativ es: Responsible for 
overseeing overall company sustainability initiatives with a specific focus on 
climate initiatives.

S1  Describe the 
climate-related risks 
and opportunities 
the organization has 
identified over the 
short, medium, and 
long term.In early 2021 , we completed a survey of several man agement-level employees 
across our five Market‑Access Platforms (MAPs) to understand which climate‑
related risks they felt were most relevant to their business units. Corning’s 
MAPs are: Optical Communications, Display, Automoti ve, Mobile Consumer 
Electronics, and Life Sciences. Using the results o f this initial risk assessment, 
Corning’s TCFD Working T eam identified seven climate‑related risks and two 
climate-related opportunities for in-depth scenario  analysis to assess the 
potential impact of risks and opportunities to our business under two different 
climate scenarios (see answer S3 for details on sce narios used). The workshop 
was held in fall 2021  and involved 33 management-le vel employees both from 
across the MAPs and from corporate-level functions.  Where possible, using 
Corning’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) impact scale adjusted to a 30‑The top three risks identified under the “1.5‑Degree” (1.5D) scenario were: 1) 
carbon pricing (short and medium terms), 2) changin g customer behavior 
(medium term) and 3) sustainable supply chain (medi um term). Increased cost 
due to carbon pricing could impact all MAPs; the Li fe Sciences MAP is already 
experiencing these effects in the European Union. I mportantly, Environmental 
Technologies (within the Automotive MAP), sees the trend toward electric 
vehicles as a potential negative business impact re sulting from a reduction in 
the number of combustion vehicles sold annually. Su pply chain sustainability 
risk, referring to both limited availability and increased cost, was identified as a 
key risk across business units.
Corning’s top opportunity under the 1.5D scenario is related to low‑carbon 
products (medium and long terms). All MAPs agree that the identified 
opportunity matches Corning's strengths in innovatio n and product 
development.

R1  Describe the 
organization’s 
processes for 
identifying and 
assessing climate-
related risks.Corning’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process is central to determining 
which risks and/or opportunities could have a subst antive strategic or 
financial impact on our business. It includes an analysis of many factors that 
include probability and impact of risks, velocity o f onset, risk response, and 
effectiveness, as well as other factors. Identified risks, including climate‑related 
risks, are evaluated in a companywide, multidiscipl inary effort. Corning's cross-
functional and cross-organizational Sustainability Working Committee (SWC) 
and Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) implemen ted a sustainability 
materiality assessment, during which carbon emissio ns and water conservation 
were identified as important sustainability issues. The resulting materiality 
assessment serves as a basis for the mentioned risk  evaluation.
More specifically, in 2020, Corning conducted an initial assessment of climate‑

 2022 STAKEHOLDER REPORT     |    3In 2022, we saw further recovery of 
the commercial aerospace industry, 
and we were encouraged by the 
favorable trends in global air traﬃc.
Air traﬃ c generally continued to trend upward throu ghout 
2022, as more passengers returned to the sky. Domes tic 
air travel continued to lead the air traﬃ c recovery , but 
international air traﬃ c made substantial strides in  2022 and 
is catching up to domestic. The majority of countri es have 
fully re-opened to international travelers and ther e is pent-
up demand for long-haul travel. People across the w orld 
are eager to get back to traveling, and 2022 was ev idence 
of that sentiment. This bodes well for a full recov ery of the 
commercial aerospace market.
While 2022 has brought encouraging signs of recover y 
from the eﬀ ects of the COVID-1 9 pandemic, it also  
presented new and unique challenges like widespread  
inﬂation, and continued constraints in global suppl y chains. 
However, despite these hurdles, TransDigm and our 
dedicated employees once again demonstrated resilie nce. 
We are proud of our team’s eﬀ orts and the operation al

2022 Review
Throughout 2022, we continued to see recovery in th e 
commercial aerospace market and further progression  
towards pre-pandemic levels of global air traﬃ c.  R evenue 
passenger kilometers (“RPKs”), a metric used to mea sure air 
traﬃ c demand, steadily improved in 2022 and many ai rcraft 
parked by airlines returned to service. Although RP Ks have 
signiﬁcantly recovered from pandemic lows, RPKs rem ained 
depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Calendar  year 
2022 RPKs are currently estimated to be down approx imately 
29%  compared to pre-pandemic levels – though that i s much 
improved from 2021  of down 58% . 
Airline passenger demand remained robust during 202 2. 
Commercial air travel in domestic markets continued  to lead 
the air traﬃ c recovery with certain domestic market s nearing 
or achieving pre-pandemic air traﬃ c levels. The pac e of the 
international recovery, though slower than the dome stic 
recovery, made positive strides in 2022 as indicate d by 
international RPKs. Most countries have now fully r eopened 
to international travelers and there is pent-up dem and for 
long-haul travel. Current industry consensus expect s that 
worldwide RPKs will recover further in 2023.
In 2022, the commercial original equipment manufact urers 
(“OEM”) market also continued to show signs of reco very 
with airlines returning to the commercial OEMs to p lace 
orders and both Boeing and Airbus increasing aircra ft 
production rates. However, the commercial OEM suppl y 
chain challenges impacting Boeing and Airbus are sl owing 
the pace of new aircraft manufacturing. Both Boeing  and 
Airbus have disclosed further planned OEM productio n rate 
increases for calendar 2023.2022 was not without its challenges.  Aside from th e residual 
negative eﬀ ects of the pandemic continuing to impac t the 
commercial aerospace industry, our business also ha d to 
navigate a diﬃ cult inﬂationary environment and disr uption 
within the global supply chain and labor markets. O ur teams 
met these challenges head-on and worked to implemen t 
mitigating actions to overcome these issues.2022 STAKEHOLDER REPORT     |    9
CONTINUING RECOVERY IN THE COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE IND USTRY
During 2022, we saw a continuation of favorable tre nds in the recovery of the commercial aerospace ind ustry and 
global air traﬃ c. Substantial progress was made dur ing 2022 in the recovery of global revenue passenge r kilometers 
(“RPKs”), although RPKs remained depressed compared  to pre-pandemic levels. Current industry consensus  indicates 
that worldwide revenue passenger miles will recover  further in 2023. As the commercial aerospace indus try continues 
to recover, we are encouraged by the trends in air traﬃ c, among other factors.

At TransDigm, we never lose sight 
of the fact that lives depend on 
our products. 
As such, quality, safety and reliability are the be drock of our 
approach to developing the highly customized produc ts 
that meet the speciﬁc needs for aircraft operators and 
manufacturers around the world. 
As our business has grown and evolved over the past  29 
years, we have maintained a relentless focus on inn ovation 
and quality to ensure the highest standards of safe ty. Our 
company-wide culture of innovation drives continuou s 
improvement on this front and leads our customers t o 
continue to select us for new business opportunitie s. 
We strive to provide products and services that exc eed our 
customers’ requirements for quality and reliability  – designing 
proprietary products that withstand the extraordina ry 
conditions and stresses that are endured during use  on an 
aircraft. The commercial aircraft component industr y is highly 
regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (“ FAA”) in 
the United States and by the European Union Aviatio n Safety 
Agency (“EASA”) in Europe and other agencies around  
the world, while the military aircraft component in dustry 
is governed by military qualiﬁcation speciﬁcations.  We, 
and the components we manufacture, are required to be 
certiﬁed by one or more of these entities or agenci es and, 
in many cases, by the individual OEM, in order to e ngineer 
and service arts and components used in speciﬁc air craft 
models. We use sophisticated equipment and procedur es 
to comply with quality requirements, speciﬁcations and FAA, 
EASA and other aviation authority requirements, as well as 
OEM requirements. We perform a variety of rigorous testing 
procedures,  such as testing under diﬀ erent temperatures, 
humidity and altitude levels, ﬂammability testing a nd shock 
and vibration testing. These types of procedures, t ogether 
with other customer-approved techniques for documen t, 
process and quality control, are used throughout al l of our

Manufacturing of a wide range of goods – from autom otive 
to household products, food production, and precisi on 
instruments – account for 20%  of employment across 
Northeast Ohio and drive half of the area’s GDP . Fo r more 
than 30 years, MAGNET has been helping fuel Northea st 
Ohio’s manufacturing growth by supporting small- an d mid-

The ﬁve-year investment will allow Cleveland Clinic  to reach 
more children in underserved communities throughout  
Northeast Ohio. 
Nearly one in four American school-aged children ha s an

In the ordinary course of business, productivity de cisions 
by the operating units have historically incorporat ed 
sustainability initiatives, but even more so as we work 
towards our GHG emissions reduction goal. TransDigm  has 
invested substantial capital into green initiative projects at 
our operating units. Energy eﬃ ciency projects at nu merous 
operating units over the last few years included so lar 
panel installation, LED lighting upgrades and other  energy

ACHIEVEMENTS AND 
PROGRESS MADE IN 2022Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”) Fifth Assessment R eport 
(AR5), 201 4. The same activity data collection proc ess and 
calculation methodologies were utilized for each ye ar’s 
inventory development. 
Our GHG emissions reduction target of at least 50%  reduction 
in our Scope 1  and Scope 2 emissions on an absolute  basis 
by 2031  demonstrates TransDigm’s commitment to miti gating 
the global eﬀ ects of climate change and being part of the 
solution. We developed our goal in alignment with t he 
Science-based Target Initiative’s (“SBTi”) Scope 1  and 2 target 
setting criteria and methodologies to limit global warming to 
1 .5˚C. The SBTi is a partnership between CDP , the U nited 
Nations Global Compact, World R esources Institute a nd the 
World Wide Fund for Nature that deﬁnes and promotes  best 
practice in emissions reduction targets in line wit h the latest 
climate science. 
T o achieve our target of a 50%  absolute reduction i n Scope 
1  and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2031 , we are activel y 
investigating options for pursuing the implementati on of 
additional energy eﬃ ciency projects at our operatio ns, 
considering sourcing renewable energy and other sol utions 
that would lower our emissions footprint. 
As disclosed in our 2021  Stakeholder R eport, we dev eloped 
a GHG inventory management plan (“IMP”) to further align 
our GHG management program with the best practices as 
stated by the GHG Protocol and to support GHG emiss ions 
inventory development. The IMP documents the founda tion 
of the GHG management program and outlines the 
accounting principles that were applied for GHG inv entory 
development. These principles, established by the G HG 
Protocol, set a standard for the true and fair repr esentation 
of our Scope 1  and Scope 2 emissions. This Plan als o guides 
the development of a GHG management program that wi ll 
be used to inform public reporting, aid in particip ation of 
mandatory and voluntary GHG programs, manage risks and 
identify reduction opportunities. 2022 STAKEHOLDER REPORT     |    28
(e.g., acquisitions, divestments, and mergers) or i f the GHG 
inventory calculation methodologies materially chan ge, 
the baseline GHG inventory will be restated to acco unt 
for this evolution. R estating the baseline year pro vides an 
accurate comparison of past and current emissions p roﬁles 
for demonstrating progress towards TransDigm’s GHG 
emissions reduction goal. It should be noted that t he base 
year will not be adjusted to take account of econom ic growth 
or decline, changes in production output or product  mix or 
closures or openings of operating units owned or co ntrolled 
by TransDigm. 
In FY2022, we acquired one new operating unit. This  
structural change represented revisions less than 1 %  to 
our historical emission proﬁle. Although this revis ion is 
minimal and below the 5%  threshold set in our IMP , we 
chose at our discretion to restate the baseline emi ssions 
inventory to simplify tracking and accounting of ac quisitions.  
We also reassessed the baseline water usage to main tain 
consistency and included the same mix of businesses   
across all measurements in Table 1 , Table 2 and the  
supplemental graphics. 
Water Consumption Inventory & Risk 
Similar to the GHG eﬀ orts in 2022, we undertook a d ata 
collection and validation process to develop our wa ter 
consumption inventory. Consistent with GHG emission s, 
FY201 9 represents our water consumption baseline ye ar. 
T otal water usage for both FY2022 and FY201 9 can be  found 
in Table 1  and supplemental graphics. As noted in t he “Our 
Carbon Footprint” section on page 26, we also reass essed the 
baseline water usage to maintain consistency and in cluded 
the same mix of businesses across all measurements in 
Table 1 , Table 2 and the supplemental graphics. Add itionally, 
during our water consumption data collection and va lidation 
process for the FY2022, we discovered and corrected  
several conversion issues in our base year data.
In the prior year, and as reported in the 2021  Stak eholder

2021  PERFORMANC E
In addition to strong financial results in 2021, we continued to make progress on our sustainability goals, including our 2025 operational goals (sustainable innovation, safety, 
community engagement) and 2027 workforce diversity goals. This data is presented below and in Appendix C .
This year, we will not report progress on our 2030 environmental goals.  In 2021, we reevaluated these goals against current data and science, and decided to commit to 
greater change across our company with more aggressive targets. Our first step was to set a net-zero target aligned with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). SBTi requires 
us to use a 2021 baseline and our previous 2030 goals compared to a 2018 baseline. We also recalculated our waste and water goals based on a 2021 baseline.
Our new environmental goals are presented on page 8 and 9 of this report. We will report on progress against these goals on a regular basis going forward.4

R&D Process Optimization
To meet our long-term goals, we need to look 
beyond our manufacturing sites.  As part of 
our robust research and development processes, 
our teams actively ensure new products are 
manufactured in line with our environmental goals. 
Recently, when developing a new herbicide, the team  
made adjustments to a complex intermediate process 
that significantly reduced the amount of hazardous 
waste generated and maximized the process output. 
These changes in how we operate demonstrate 
our company’s commitment to safeguarding the 
environment for future generations.
Ecosystem Restoration
PROJ EC T SEMEAR
Reforesting the Cerrado Biome
The Cerrado is a vast tropical area of land, and one of 
the world’s most biodiversity-rich ecosystems, located 
in central Brazil. A large portion of the Cerrado is used 
for farming – mainly soybeans and corn. Protecting 
biodiversity and preserving vital ecosystems like the 
Cerrado is essential to ensuring a healthy planet and 
mitigating climate change. 
FMC works closely with Brazilian farmers to provide 
solutions that maximize crop yields on existing 
farmland to minimize further agricultural expansion 
into areas like the Cerrado. We know that restoring 
the land is just as important as conserving it, so in 
2021, we joined forces with the local soybean grower FOR GENERATIONS TO COME1 3FMC 2021  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT1 4
Our growing portfolio of biostimulants provides muc h-
needed tools to farmers facing increasingly difficult 
growing conditions due to climate change. In additi on 
to improving soil health, biostimulants increase cr ops’ 
resilience to environmental stresses, including ext reme 
temperatures, salinity and drought. Solutions like FMC’s 
Furagro™ Legend organic fertilizer help farmers in 
India to improve crops’ response to drought. The 
product works at a very low dose rate and is powere d 
by SURGE Technology (Selective Upregulation of Gene  
Expression) that improves a plant’s gene activation  
responsible for various plant functions. FMC plans to 
make this solution available to growers across mult iple 
countries in Asia and Europe starting in 2023. 
The need for sustainable solutions like biologicals  is 
growing by the day and we are preparing to meet 
that need, investing in new partnerships and research 
and development capabilities to accelerate innovation 
in the global biological market.

Precision and Digital Agriculture
A new generation of farmers, equipped with 
smartphones, field monitoring systems and GPS-
guided equipment, is shaping the future of agriculture 
globally. Precision and digital agriculture technologies 
help farmers better protect their crops while using less 
energy, water and traditional inputs. For example, 
our 3RIVE 3D® application system is a precision 
application technology that uses 90 percent less 
water than alternative systems and can reduce 
carbon emissions from product application by up 
to 80 percent.  FMC is investing significantly in these 
technologies to sustainably increase agricultural 
productivity around the world.
With a focus on crop care, we are developing 
digital solutions that advance sustainable 
agriculture by identifying pest infestations before  
they become a problemFMC 2021  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT1 6
PARTNERSHIPS TO ADVANC E  
SUSTAINABLE AGRIC ULTURE
FMC / Irritec “On the Roots”
Farmer education on how advancements in modern 
agriculture improve sustainable productivity is a key 
component of FMC’s efforts to drive transformational 
change in agriculture. Our teams engage more than 
3 million farmers around the world, annually, through 
in-person training as well as broader awareness-
building activities. 
Last year, FMC formed a unique partnership with Irr itec 
Group, a world leader in precision irrigation, to e ngage 
Italian farmers on topics related to sustainable fa rming. 
Together with Irritec, we launched “On the Roots,”  
an outreach campaign to farmers and distributors, 
designed to increase adoption of innovative solutio ns 
that maximize crop yield and nutrition while minimi zing 
environmental impact. The campaign focused on topic s 
such as increasing efficiency and optimizing water use, 
the correct use of crop protection solutions to com bat 
resistance, and the use of biologicals to promote p lant 
health and defend against pests and disease. 
The “On the Roots” campaign, which resulted in a 
docuseries that aired on FMC and Irritec social media 
channels, highlighted Italian farmers who embrace 
sustainability in their business. The campaign also allowed us to hear from farmers We care for our Soil.
Today we take a pledge to use appropriate 
agri-inputs and save our soil. We take a 
 pledge to keep our soil rich in organic matter 
and beneficial microbes. We take a pledge  
to take this knowledge about  
soil heath importance to our neighbors, 
families, relatives and friends.
We respect our Soil.1 7
Throughout the program’s first year, FMC employees 
conducted daily farmer meetings in 240 villages acr oss 
India, educating 100,000 farmers, distributors and 
retailers about the impact soil nutrient levels hav e on 
crop production. FMC also provided free soil testin g, 
conducted by a certified agronomist, which measured 
several aspects of soil health, including pH, EC, o rganic 
matter and nutrient status. Farmers received a repo rt 
on their soil quality as well as guidance on creati ng 
optimal fertility conditions for plant growth. 
What sets UGAM apart is its innovative approach  
to engaging farmers. The FMC team travels to 
farming villages in a large passenger van equipped 
with videos, virtual reality simulators and interactive 
games for farmers to learn more about maintaining 
healthy ecosystems. The program seeks to transform 
the traditional farmer meeting into an immersive,

India Water Stewardship Program
Agriculture in India accounts for more than 80 
percent* of the surface water used across the 
country. Amid growing concerns about water scarcity 
exacerbated by rising global temperatures, we 
launched a World Water Day campaign to promote 
water stewardship on farms across the country.
In 2021, FMC’s India team hosted more than 400 
knowledge-sharing sessions with farmers across 
18 states, reaching more than 14,000 members of 
India’s farming community. Each session focused 
on good agricultural practices for enhancing farm 
sustainability, and shared different methods to 
optimize water use and enhance efficiency.“On World Water Day 2021, our focus was on educating farmers on best 
practices to enhance sustainable management of freshwater resources. 
We have been partnering with Indian farmers across crop chains and 
geographies to drive sustainability and improve productivity for over three 
decades in India. We have over 4,000 technical field experts who engage 
with over two million farmers annually to promote sustainable agricultural 
practices for a better future. Our goal is to empower the farming community  
and raise their living standards through various initiatives and community  
outreach programs such as Project Samarth. ”Pramod Thota , interim President for FMC’s  FOR GENERATIONS TO COME1 9
Building Pollinator Habitats at FMC
As part of our overall pollinator protection efforts, we 
have planted pollinator habitats at six FMC locations 
across North America. The project, conducted in 
consultation with the Bee & Butterfly Habitat Fund, 
involves planting native plant varieties, suited for the 
local conditions at each site. The plants are chosen 
based on their benefits to specific pollinator species 
such as honey bees and monarch butterflies. 
This work can involve up to a year of site preparat ion 
before the habitat is planted to ensure optimal 
growing conditions. The most advanced habitat is 
at our research station in Illinois, U.S. The habitat 
flourished during 2021, with different species 
flowering at different times throughout the summer 
months, creating everchanging blankets of red, whit e, 
orange, blue and yellow. As a part of site tours, 
business partners and community groups visited the 
habitats and received information about pollinators 
and the importance of pollinator protection.The habitat will support a diversity of pollinators  across 
all stages of their lifecycles as well as provide e mployees FMC 2021  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT22
PROGRESS ON WORKFORC E DIVERSITY GOALS  
We continue to make progress toward our workforce

MAKING FMC  A GREAT PLAC E TO WORK
Despite experiencing yet another unprecedented year 
in 2021, our global network of Employee Resource 
Groups  (ERGs) and Regional Inclusion Councils  
remained very active, pivoting to execute key 
programs virtually. These groups help drive employee 
engagement and support our global DEI strategy. 
Our Regional Inclusion Councils and ERGs facilitate 
events and programs that celebrate diversity, increase 
awareness and understanding of inclusion concepts 
and build allyship. They also leverage partnerships 
to address local DEI needs. Our signature global DEI 
efforts include:Inclusion Month
FMC officially dedicates October to Inclusion Month

LGBTQ+ Inclusion at FMC
In 2021, FMC joined the Human Rights Campaign’s 
Business Coalition for the Equality Act in support 
of legal LGBTQ+ equality.  FMC’s Government Affairs 
team was instrumental in advancing our endorsement 
of this important U.S. legislation. 
FMC’s LGBTQ+ ERG, Spectrum, worked with Human 
Resources (HR) on LGBTQ+ inclusion in FMC’s  
human resources and recruiting practices. Efforts 
focused on understanding the challenges faced by 
transgender and gender non-conforming employees 
in the workplace specifically in navigating a 
company’s HR infrastructure. Thanks to their work, 
FMC’s Employee Central T alent Profile now 
includes an option for employees to provide their

in Agriculture
While much progress has been made on gender 
equity in business and in broader society, the 
fight for fair and equal opportunities for women 
isn’t over, and in many parts of the world, 
has only just begun. At FMC, we understand 
real progress is made by taking steps 
every single day that over time amount to 
lasting systemic and cultural change. For 
us, it’s about removing barriers, creating 
opportunities and addressing bias at every 
level of the organization.FOR GENERATIONS TO COME25

Suzhou, China EMPOWERING WOMEN IN MANUFAC TURING
After committing to a gender balance goal of 50 
percent women in the global workforce by 2027 , 
we set out to understand where the gaps and 
opportunities are across the company. Operations 
is one area we focused on. At the beginning of 
2021, women accounted for only 23.9 percent 
of employees in Operations. We knew that if we 
wanted to change our culture, we had to start with  
our manufacturing sites.
We engaged leaders at each of the sites to ensure 
they understood and were equipped to support the 
company’s gender goal. Then we began work to 
improve job structures, workplace environment and 
infrastructure to make manufacturing jobs accessible 
to anyone. These include automating certain tasks 
to reduce manual handling and making ergonomic 
changes to jobs that require heavy lifting, allowin g 
people of all physical capabilities to perform the 
job. We also made infrastructural changes at our 
manufacturing sites to ensure accessibility and 
consideration for our female workforce. These inclu ded 
adding/updating changing rooms, lactation rooms, 
bathrooms with showers as well as some gender-

SPOTLIGHT ON FMC  LEAD PROGRAM - 
AUSTRALIA-NEW ZEALAND 
Women currently comprise approximately half of the 
agricultural workforce in Australia but occupy just  
23.3 percent* of key management positions within  
the sector. FMC is determined to change that.
As part of FMC’s focus on providing more equitable 
opportunities for women to progress their careers and 
participate at senior leadership levels, the Australia-
New Zealand (ANZ) team launched the LEAD 
scholarship program in 2021. 
Designed to support the next generation of female 
leaders, the inaugural program is for women between 
the ages of 18-35 who are involved in agriculture in 
Australia or New Zealand. The application process 
provides a platform for women to share their 
perspective on key challenges the industry is facing 
and propose solutions in one of three areas:  
The program offers two successful applicants 
development opportunities through idea sharing, 
networking and a tailored education package.

supporting women like Kareena and Malkah who 
can offer more diversity of thought. Seeing more

With limited career choices for female graduates in 
rural areas of Pakistan, FMC established a Sales Field 
Trainee Program to help increase gender diversity in 
field-based roles. 
The program is targeted to women enrolled in 
agriculture programs in the region and leverages 
partnerships with local universities, including the 
Agriculture University of Faisalabad, University of 
Punjab and Muhammad Nawaz Sharif Agriculture 
University of Multan, to reach potential participants. 
In 2021, five students enrolled in the program and 
underwent over two months of practical, hands-on 
training to learn the complete sales job cycle. Fol lowing

Further, Black growers 
are often overlooked 
for programs, 
incentives, new 
products or technology 
that can increase 
their productivity and competitiveness. We heard 
this from many growers when we held a series 
of listening sessions in partnership with the 
National Black Growers Council (NBGC) to better 
understand the unique challenges of Blacks and 
African Americans in maintaining and growing 
their farming operations. 
After these sessions, we took a hard look at the issues 
and determined we had to do more to ensure future 
generations of Black growers are successful.
For FMC, this is about being intentional and about 
making a deliberate effort to engage underrepresent ed 
farming communities. For example, last summer we 
partnered with the NBGC to facilitate a series of 
Model Farm tours for Black and African American 
growers in the southern U.S. Our technical, researc h 
and commercial teams provided information and 
demonstrations of FMC’s technologies, including 
our 3RIVE 3D® application system and Arc™ farm

growers interested in bringing the latest agricultu ral

How long have you been with FMC?
I joined FMC in January 2018 as the Rønland  
Site Manager.
Why is safety important to you?
The commitments we make in our safety manifesto are  
not just words. Nothing is more important than peop le. 
It’s my job to ensure the safety of the site and a big 
motivator for me as a person. Fundamentally, I beli eve 
safety is where it all starts. If we are not safe, we won’t 
make quality products and we won’t be competitive. 
What are some of the ways you’ve worked 
to build a safety culture at Rønland?
Leaders need to lead – to be role models, to be 
involved and to act on every potential risk. The main 
tool we use to help us do this is MBWA (Management 
by Walking Around). It’s about getting out in the site, 
looking for specific issues and resolving them before 
they become a safety hazard. It’s important to talk  
to your colleagues about safety and help people to  
be safe. 
Leaders must “walk the talk,” be present and visible, 
to foster a safety culture throughout the whole site.  
When you reflect on the past year, what  
do you believe was really successful? 
In 2021, Rønland set a new record with 402 
days without a recordable injury. This was a big 
achievement that we were all very proud of. But it 
was also a sad day as a colleague was injured. It was 
a reminder to all of us that we have to be safe one  
task at a time, one day at a time, every day. FOR GENERATIONS TO COME37
SAFETY IN THE FIELD
South Africa Sponsors Construction of Cages  
for Empty Agrochemical Containers Destined  
for Recycling
Safe disposal of product containers and packaging 
is critical to protecting the health and safety of 
farmers, their communities and the environment. 
Our product stewardship teams around the world 
conduct hundreds of hours of training and provide 
informational materials to millions of farmers every 
year on responsible use of crop protection products, 
including container management. 
Last year, the team in South Africa partnered with key 
distributors throughout the country to construct ca ges 
for storing empty agrochemical containers until they 
are ready to be recycled. A large percentage of these 
containers are typically thrown away, burned, buried 
or sold for reuse in illegal counterfeiting, which can 
have lasting, damaging effects on the environment a nd 
pose a safety risk to farmers and their communities . 
The storage cages make it easier and more efficient 
for farmers to recycle empty product containers, 
encouraging safer, more sustainable practices. 
The first cage was constructed in Polokwane and has 
been in use since June 2021. Two additional cages, 
one in Lxopo and one in Underberg, were completed 
in December 2021. To date, the response from 
farmers has been very positive.

a. Describe the climate-related risks 
and opportunities the organization 
has identified over the short, medium 
and long term.Climate change may impact markets in which we sell our products, 
where, for example, a prolonged drought may result i n decreased 
demand for our products. The more gradual effects o f persistent 
temperature change in geographies with significant agricultural lands 
may result in changes in lands suitable for agricul ture or changes 
in the mix of crops suitable for cultivation and th e pests that may 
be present in such geographies. For example, prolonged increase in 
average temperature may make northern lands suitable for growing 
crops not grown historically in such climes, leading  farmers to shift 
from crops such as wheat to soybean and may result in new or 
different weed, plant disease or insect pressures on such crops – such 
changes would impact the mix of pesticide products farmers would 
purchase, which may be adverse for us, depending on the local market 
and our product mix. Additionally, changes in the g overnmental 
regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, 
could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional 
costs or limits on operations. 
Our markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely 
impact crop pricing and pest infestations. For example, drought may 
reduce the need for fungicides, which could result in fewer sales and 
greater unsold inventories in the market, whereas excessive rain could 
lead to increased plant disease or weed growth requ iring growers 
to purchase and use more pesticides. Drought and/or  increased 
temperatures may change insect pest pressures, requiring growers to 
use more, less, or different insecticides. Natural disasters can impact 
production at our facilities in various parts of the world. The nature of 
these events makes them difficult to predict.
In our product portfolio, we see market opportuniti es for our products to 
address climate change and its impacts. For example , FMC’s agricultural 
solutions can help customers increase yield, energy  and water 
efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Our solutions can 
also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growi ng conditions and 
the effects these types of threats have on crops. F MC has committed to 
invest 100 percent of our research and development pipeline budget to 
developing sustainable products and solutions for f uture use.p.6-11 ; 2021 Form 10-k p.8-13

conducting climate related scenario analyses consis tent with the 
recommendations provided by the Taskforce for Clima te-Related 
Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). As part of the TCFD scenario analysis, 
we are currently evaluating the potential risks at operation sites, 
leveraging scenarios published by the International  Energy Agency

Synchrony for success in the post-COVID-19 world. Our Board also oversaw management’s adoption of eight new strategic 
workstreams, including several that impact our ESG activitie s by addressing: With seven of 12 of our directors being women and/or 
minorities, Synchrony has one of the most diverse Board of 
Directors of any financial services company or commercial

To best champion our customers, new employees are r equired to complete training courses on a broad range  of topics, including 
data security; fair lending; unfair, deceptive or abusive ac ts or practices (UDAAP); and other banking laws and regulati ons.  
We require nearly all employees, as well as our Board, to  refresh their training in these areas annually. 
Fair dealing extends to our suppliers’ employees, too. We as sign them courses based on the type of work they perform and th eir 
level of interaction with Synchrony customers. Most supplier employe es in the training program complete similar courses on fair

New Ways to Work. New Ways to Grow.
Since our initial public offering in 2014, Synchrony’s values and culture have been at the center of who 
we are and all we do. Acting boldly is one of Synchrony’s core values, as is caring for our employees, 
customers and community. If ever there was a time to truly exemplify these values, it was 2020. No one 
could have foreseen how COVID-19 would put Synchrony to the test, but we put our values into action 
and our people first to propel our business forward. Social justice movements became a powerful force 
in 2020 with demands for social justice and racial equity. We deepened our commitment to further 
learning, action and change on behalf of all those who are underrepresented, marginalized or 
discriminated against. 
The events and decisions, big and small, in 2020 have contributed to a transformation at Synchrony. 
Synchrony has become more agile and bolder in decision making, while keeping our employees, our 
customers and our values central. 16 / 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORTKEEPING EVERYONE SAFE
As the global pandemic gained momentum in the United States 
and the number of COVID-19 cases steadily rose, so did concer ns 
for our employees’ health and safety. By early March of 2020, 
Synchrony decided the safest place for all employees was not in 
the office, but at home. 
Executing this decision presented a massive logisti cal challenge. 
It included getting each employee set up at home and providing 
them with the technology and support needed to be as effective 
as they were onsite. Leaders across all levels and functions of the 
organization mobilized to make it happen. Incredibly, nearly all 
U.S. Synchrony employees were productively working from thei r 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT  / 17VIRTUAL HUB

For a company the size of Synchrony, going fully remote takes more than tellin g employees to continue working from home. In our case,  
it took three basic constructs:
1.  All Synchrony employees will be given the option of being remote employe es. Employees who choose to permanently  work from home, 
including post-pandemic, are given a stipend to cover the co st of setting up their home office.
2. We replaced our sites with hubs   18 / 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORTRole model our work at

Working Against Injustice.40  / 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORTHELP WHERE IT’S NEEDED MOST
Though the coronavirus infects people of all ages and races , it’s especially hard on vulnerable populations. Black/Afr ican American, 
Hispanic and Native American communities are disproportionally a ffected, as are senior citizens. Small businesses and resta urants 
are still struggling. Many have closed. Unemployment conti nues to rise. Worse yet, many local food bank shelves were nea rly empty 
for much of the year. 
In 2020, Synchrony focused on helping communities a nd families alleviate these and other pandemic-relate d challenges. 
Focusing on “Families That Work.” 
Synchrony’s multifaceted citizenship platform, Families That Work , helps struggling low- and moderate-income working  families 
improve their situation—and their lives. Our program focus es on 1) offering safe and stable housing alternatives to famil ies who are 
homeless or on the verge of homelessness, 2) childcare for pa rents who need a safe place for their children while they work , 3) 
economic security so families can move ahead and 4) access to healthy, nutritious food. Our matching gift and grant progra ms 
offer critical financial support to nonprofits making a differe nce in the lives of all our communities. In 2020, our total con tribution to 
charitable organizations was more than $20 million.
Diverting Homelessness
Local communities are adopting diversion strategies to keep f amilies out of emergency shelters. At least 30% of households seeking 
shelter can successfully remain in or be placed in housing at significantly less than the cost of shelter. Synchrony has pa rtnered with 
Family Promise, a non profit committed to ending homelessnes s, to launch a pilot diversion initiative in 10 U.S. cities. 
The Synchrony Foundation committed $1.2 million to support the Family Promise Affiliate in each city. Each Affiliate rece ived virtual 
shelter diversion training and $50,000 in funding, most of wh ich will be used to directly help struggling families. When the year-long 
pilot ends, Family Promise will develop best practices to rol l out to all its Affiliates across the country.

Childcare needs prior to the pandemic were challenging, esp ecially for low- and moderate-income parents struggling to w ork to 
provide for their families while ensuring their kids were nu rtured and kept safe outside of school hours. With the pandem ic and  
many schools going to virtual classes or a hybrid of in-school and virtual cl asses, parents found themselves facing an even trickier 
juggling act. 
This was especially true for parents of children with specia l needs. Synchrony has been a proud supporter of United Rehab ilitation 
Services (URS) in Dayton, Ohio for several years. Founded in 1 956, URS provides accredited programs for children and adul ts with 
developmental and acquired disabilities, including cerebral palsy , autism, down syndrome, muscular dystrophy and Alzheimer ’s 
disease. URS provides a comprehensive array of services und er one roof, including five educational programs for infants, to ddlers, 
preschoolers and school-age children and also offers ad ult day programs, vocational training and employment services f or adults 
and high school students. Although deemed an essential serv ice, URS was unable to open at full capacity, but was able to pr ovide 
limited services to the children of essential workers. The g rant from Synchrony helped to support 60 children, ages 3 to 1 7 with

Helping to End Hunger 
According to the United Nations’ 2020 “Global Report on Food C rises (GRFC),” hunger and food insecurity were growing prob lems 
before COVID-19. By driving massive unemployment, the pand emic has only worsened this situation. While hard to believe, every 
community in the United States has families who now struggle with hunger and food insecurity every day. 
Synchrony committed $5 million for COVID-19 relief efforts. Of that $5 million, Synchrony donated $1.5 million to be allo cated to 
national hunger nonprofits, including Feeding America’s® C OVID-19 Response Fund to help food banks across the country su pport 
affected communities and Meals on Wheels America to ensure ol der adults continue to receive the vital lifeline they need. The 
remaining $3.5 million is supporting organizations to tackl e long-term needs in hard-hit communities as the outbreak cont inues  
to unfold. 
Synchrony’s corporate headquarters in Stamford teamed up w ith Sodexo and Food Rescue US to feed area families impacted b y 
the economic fallout from the pandemic. Starting at 5 a.m. each day, we opene d our kitchen and provided the ingredients for 
Sodexo to prepare 100 meals a day. Food Rescue US then deliver ed the meals to Stamford’s Domus Kids Inc, the Boys & Girls Clu b, 
CT Housing Partners and Yearwood Center. In total, 13,600 me als were delivered. 46 / 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORTSynchrony employees and their families also got involved, assemblin g emergency food and hygiene packs for Native American high 
school and college students involved with American Indian B usiness Leaders impacted by the pandemic. Called “Packs of 
Inspiration,” they contained handwritten notes of e ncouragement from the families who packed them.  
The Synchrony team in Manila, Philippines helped sc hool children get much-needed nutrition. Before the p andemic, Philippine anti-
hunger program Gawad Kalinga made and delivered thousands o f healthy lunches daily to public schools in Manila. But when 
COVID-19 struck, the government closed its large Central Ki tchen and suspended classes. However, with support from Sync hrony, 
Gawad Kalinga was able to switch to community-based kitchen s run by parents and Gawad Kalinga volunteers. 
Education as the Equalizer
At Synchrony, we believe that education should be accessible to all. Altho ugh we know a four-year college degree has real potential 
to change the trajectory of someone’s life, especially t hat of a low- or moderate-income, minority first-generation studen t, we also 
know that any type of additional education or training can be beneficial in helping someone learn a job or build a career. 
Synchrony’s Education as the Equalizer program has two foci, to help low- and moderate-income diverse students to gradua te from 
a four-year college or get the skills and training they need for gainful empl oyment. 
St. John’s University is a private, coeducational, Roman Ca tholic university founded in 1870 by the Congregation of the Mission (the 
Vincentians), with its main campus located in Queens, NY. As of Fall 2020, the University had 1,400 full-time and part-ti me faculty, 
over 15,500 undergraduate students, and nearly 4,50 0 graduate students who come from 45 states and 121 countries. The 
Synchrony Scholarship at St. John’s provides one or mo re partial annual scholarships to undergraduate students w ith a grade point

Our employees built homes and beautified neighborhoods.  
They mentored inner-city students and assembled bic ycles. 
They helped the homeless, fed the hungry and befriended  
the lonely. They are always ready to pitch in and lend a

Feeding America
In 2020, we didn’t let the pandemic stop us from coming 
together to help those in need. We simply switched from 
in-person teams to individual/virtual ones. For exa mple, we 
connected a large group of remote employees from different 
sites to fill emergency meal kits for homeless individuals and 
families. Volunteers bought food items, packed them up and 
included a handwritten inspirational note. The pack ages were 
shipped to a Feeding America warehouse for distribution by 
their emergency response teams.

ensuring that those experiencing homelessness had fa ce 
masks; and writing notes of encouragement for those 
experiencing isolation during the pandemic.

Synchrony’s Gear Up Initiative was our consolidated, 
grassroots effort to help “gear up” those on the front lines in 
health, safety and other essential roles. In the early stages of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, protective gear for frontline worke rs 
and volunteers was in short supply—especially masks. 
Synchrony wasted no time in rallying our networks to help 
solve the problem. 
Synchrony employees, along with our small- to medium-sized 
sewing business partners (and many of their 140,000 “Sewing 
and More” credit cardholders) sprang into action. And, with 
our nonprofit partner buildOn, we helped to protect people 
around the world from the spread of the coronavirus by 
making no-sew face masks. We debuted this activity at the 
Synchrony Summer Camp with buildOn students 
demonstrating how to make the masks. Synchrony empl oyees 
and buildOn students eagerly helped and together made 
26,000 face masks.* 
Thirty-two employees in our Hyderabad site created over 
1,300 masks. These masks were donated to support service 
workers and institutional staff like the Anganwadi workers an d 
police who have kept the State’s critical systems functional  
through the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown. And, to 
help struggling women and their families, all the cloth was 
procured as raw material from the Weavers Society of 
Narayanpet District, which supports the livelihood of wome n 
and weavers.Overall, with the efforts of our small- to medium-sized sewing 
business partners, buildOn students and Synchrony 
employees, we made a total of 77,000 masks. 
Synchrony employees who had 3D printers at home also 
pitched in, printing over 3,700 masks, face shields and ear 
savers. Synchrony also bought over a dozen 3D printers for 
employees and their families who wanted to help out. In 
addition, the Synchrony Foundation and Synchrony teamed up 
with global charity Brother’s Brother Foundation, one of ou r 
local Ohio suppliers Stephens Direct, and locally owned small  
business Protoduction 3D, to produce and distribute more 
than 5,000 face shields to Synchrony site communities in 
need across the United States.

Today, Synchrony supports nearly a million small bu sinesses—
from retailers and veterinarians to home stores and 
automotive repair shops. The impact of the coronavirus on our 
small business partners has been crushing for many.  In 
response, we stepped up our support and launched Synchrony 
Connect for Small Business, a digital resource for business 
advice and best practices, consumer insights and we binars, 
and access to a host of powerful digital tools to help grow, 
lead and operate their businesses. 
Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC)
As Synchrony sees it, small businesses are the backbone of 
our economy and deserve our support now more than ever. 
The Synchrony Foundation has committed $5 million to 
community development organizations that support sm all 
businesses and will help those hit hard by the pandemic 
recover and rebuild. This includes $3 million to local 
organizations to support long-term small business r ecovery 
over the next three years. We committed the remaining $2 
million to LISC to be used for emergency relief to small 
businesses hit hard by the pandemic. LISC is one of the 
nation’s largest, non-profit community development financial 
institutions, supporting community development init iatives in 
37 cities and across 2,200 rural counties in 45 states. 
LISC will use the funds to provide emergency grants of up to 
$10,000 to help small businesses address their immediate 
financial needs—focusing on minority-, women-, and veteran-
owned businesses in underserved communities. The fu nds will 
also enable LISC partners with frontline experience to help 
small businesses weather the pandemic through train ing, 
resources and technical assistance. This includes w eb- 
based and remote sales and marketing, social media  
and accounting. Just one year ago, the picture was bright for Nasshon “Lovely ” 
Thompson. 2019 was the culmination of Lovely’s 20-year 
journey in America. Her business, Lovely’s Boutique & Beaut y 
Supply, was thriving at its location on Main Street in 
Bridgeport, CT. However, 2020 brought the kind of challenges 
no one could have anticipated. COVID-19 shut Lovely’s doors 
for quite a while, but even after it reopened (under distancing 
guidelines, the store has room for five customers at any one 
time), business remained anemic. “It has affected my 
community a great deal,” she says. “There’s nowhere to go, 
and we’re not getting dressed. It’s only the nurses and the 
CNAs that go out, and they wear scrubs.” In 2000, Nasshon 
immigrated to the United States, later bringing her two olde st 
children here, attaining legal immigration status, and having  
a third child, now 13, in Queens, where “Lovely’s” was starte d. 
She moved the beauty shop to Connecticut in 2017. Thompson 
has put her Licensed Practical Nurse degree to use, and is 
working other odd jobs, but remains optimistic about the 
future. “This grant will help me cover rent, lights a nd 
insurance,” explained Thompson. “It’s a much-needed and 
appreciated bridge to the day when business picks up  
on the strength of women with places to go and statements  
to make.”

America Saves Week + Money 360° =  
Big Savings
America Saves is a multichannel media campaign manag ed 
by the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America. Their aim  
is to get low- to moderate-income households to set a 
financial goal to save money and achieve important steps 
toward financial wellness. In a 2018 Federal Reserve survey, 
almost 40% of American adults wouldn’t be able to cover a 
$400 emergency with cash, savings or a credit-card charge 
that they could quickly pay off. Synchrony knows, Savers with 
a plan are more than twice as likely to achieve their savings 
goals as those without a plan.
That’s why Synchrony, along with 2,000 other financial 
institutions, government agencies, community groups  and 
nonprofits, joined the America Saves Council for America 
Saves Week during the last week of February to promote the 
importance of saving with the America Saves pledge and 
financial wellness education and resources. Concurrent with 
that is Synchrony’s MONEY 360°, an ongoing program 
devoted to promoting savings—both for Synchrony emp loyees 
and the communities we serve. In 2020, we saw a 12% lift in 
new savings customers, a 14% lift in recurring transfers to 
Synchrony Bank savings accounts and a 25% lift of customer 
adding money to their account during America Saves Week.  54 / 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORTGetting Smart About Money

Our approach to sustainability is informed by the 
environmental goals in the United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), a global blueprint to achieve  
a more fair and sustainable future.
Synchrony monitors the environmental impacts from our  
direct operations, and we use the data to reduce our impact. 
Monitoring involves taking a global inventory of di rect and 
indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using the 
international GHG protocol methodology. The results of the 
inventory are set out in the Global Synchrony Environmental  
and Sustainability Key Metrics table (Table 1) on page 65. 
Synchrony also monitors indicators such as water, waste, 
recycling and paper used by its operations in order to  
optimize operations and gradually reduce consumptio n.
Responding to COVID-19—Occupational  
Safety and Health
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Synchrony’s 
Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) team created 
processes and systems, procured protective equipmen t,  
and shared self-awareness skills to help our organization  
keep employees and contractors, and by extension, t heir 
families and their communities, healthy and safe. Our EHS  
and Facilities teams, along with other medical and security 
specialists, have been advising on actions to slow the spread 
of the virus and to help employees stay safe from physical 
hazards on and off the job. 
For example, to reduce the risk of virus transmission in 
Synchrony-operated buildings, we utilized a company -wide 
multi-engineering control strategy based on CDC 
recommendations and guidance from The American Soci ety 
of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers 
(ASHRAE) intended to minimize the transmission of viruses vi a our HVAC systems. Our buildings’ first line of defense agains t 
aerosol transmission is through a fresh outdoor air dilution 
strategy, and settings were modified in all Synchrony-opera ted 
buildings to supply fresh airflow rates towards maximum 
system design effectiveness 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week in order to promote adequate refreshment of the  
building’s indoor environment. 
Working from Home
According to independent and public health governme ntal 
agencies, air quality is the largest environmental risk to public 
health in the United States. Additionally, energy consumptio n 
from work commutes can have an enormous negative 
environmental health effect on employees and their 
communities. A silver lining of the pandemic has been the 
drastic reduction in our carbon footprint as our employees 
shifted to home-based offices.
In September 2020, Synchrony reimagined how employe es 
work, and committed to delivering maximum flexibility for ou r 
people and our company by embracing a new work-from-
home model, giving our employees in the United States and 
Puerto Rico the option to work from home permanently— even 
after the pandemic. We are excited for this new journey which 
will help us drive fundamental changes to be a faster, more 
agile and innovative company, all while doing our part to help 
the environment. 
The unprecedented shift to working from home prompted by 
the pandemic also created several ergonomic challeng es for 
our newly remote workforce. We now manage employee 
ergonomic health, safety and welfare in uncontrolled, non-
designed home spaces. When the pandemic struck, we moved 
quickly to equip nearly all employees to work from h ome—  
that included our thousands of customer service agen ts in  
call centers. 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT  / 61 At the same time, our EHS team responded to the new  
work-from-home ergonomic and accommodation challeng es. 
Synchrony implemented several programs to help empl oyees 
get comfortable in their new home offices and minimize 
unwanted outcomes. Programs offered included virtual 
ergonomic evaluations, self-help digital ergonomic 
assessments, ergonomic office chairs, dual monitors,  
as well as web- and videoconference-based training  
sessions on how to set up an ergonomic workspace at home. 
Protecting Water Resources
We closely monitor our water usage and spending and invest  
in water security and efficiency initiatives. Synchrony’s wa ter 
usage has declined over the years, from 17.0 gallons/ft2 in 2018 
to 11.7 gallons/ft2 in 2020—which equates to a more than 30% 
overall use intensity decline (see Table 1). 
Our water efficiency systems include kitchen greywater 
systems, temperature controls and cool air recircula tion, rain 
sensor irrigation controlling, cooling tower water recovery 
installations, stormwater commercial irrigation mon itoring, 
systems to recover blowdown energy to heat boiler feed 
water, low flow fixtures in our restrooms, proper dishwasher 
settings and use, and water faucet leak audits. 
Greening our Buildings
The goal of using green building principles to support energy 
efficiency in new buildings and renovations is to create high 
performance buildings that have limited environment al 
impact and the lowest possible life-cycle costs. Synchrony 
follows good sustainable engineering and building p ractices 
which seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of 
buildings by enhancing efficiency and moderation in the use 
of energy, space and materials. Simply put, sustain able 
building design involves saving energy, using space efficiently  
and reducing waste over the lifecycle of a building. Energy-efficient equipment performs the same or better whil e 
using less energy, reducing expense and helping protect the 
environment by reducing Synchrony’s carbon footprint. 
ENERGY STAR certification is the most reliable and widely 
recognized mark of efficiency from the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA). Over 70% of Synchrony’s global 
operating square footage footprint meets EPA ENERGY STAR 
status, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design 
(LEED) certifications. These certifications provide a framework  
for assessing the success of ongoing greening efforts 
throughout our sites. In 2020, by meeting ENERGY STAR and 
LEED standards, we reduced our global annual baseline GHG 
emissions by more than 9,414 tons. That translates into an 
energy cost savings of approximately $1 million. 
In 2019 and 2020, several of our facility operations installed 
variable frequency drives (VFDs). VFDs are used in the 
ventilation systems to save large amounts of energy by 
regulating the frequency of electric currents and matching air 
movement to demand. Our former Kettering site has gone 
through a series of carefully planned and executed energy-
conserving initiatives over the last several years including 
increased efficiency chilled water temperature recirculatio n, 
alarm electrical control demand, low horsepower sum mer 
boiler cycling, and variable frequency drives on our cooling 
tower fan motors. Collectively, this has resulted in a total 
energy savings of nearly $5 million. 62 / 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORTSustainable Business Travel
Travel, whether it be by car, train or air, accounts for a 
significant amount of GHG emissions. Synchrony has 
prioritized reducing unnecessary business travel. Our trav el 
policy engages our travel management provider to pr ovide 
monthly GHG emission reporting with statistics and live 
information on the most environmentally friendly op tion at the 
time of booking. Starting well before the pandemic began,  
we actively promoted the use of videoconferencing when 
possible in place of traveling to onsite meetings. 
Breaking the Paper Habit—Conserving Paper  
to Reduce Environmental Impact 
Trees provide key advantages for high-level environ mental 
sustainability. They combat climate change by absor bing 
GHG emissions, release oxygen back into the atmosphere, 
save water, prevent water pollution, prevent the erosion of soil 
and conserve energy. Synchrony understands the impo rtance 
of saving trees and is passionate about going paperless. In 
2019, ahead of Earth Day, we partnered with American Forests 
to encourage our customers to move to digital credit card 
statements. Synchrony planted over 42,000 trees for  
customers who signed up for paperless statements du ring  
this campaign. 
The COVID-19 pandemic underscores how interconnected our 
world has become—and that the health and well-being of 
people is deeply linked to that of our planet. As wildfires 
ravage many parts of the world, from the western United 
States to Brazil and Australia, and many regions experience 
some of the most extreme weather events on record, we must 
urgently invest in innovative ways to inspire collective action 
to address climate change.In 2020, Synchrony joined the Mastercard Priceless Planet 
Coalition as another initiative to build a more inclusive an d 
sustainable environment, where the planet can thrive. The 
Priceless Planet Coalition unites the efforts of consumers, 
financial institutions, merchants and cities to fight climate 
change through the restoration of 100 million trees over five 
years—together with climate science and forest restor ation 
experts Conservation International and World Resources 
Institute. Coalition partners in multiple regions are launch ing 
campaigns to enlist consumers in environmental acti on and 
reforestation efforts with innovative donation technologies.
Paper waste prevention aims to reduce or eliminate paper use 
and avoid inefficient paper use and disposal in the first 
instance. As a result, prevention is the most environmentally 
preferable means to reduce paper waste, minimizing the 
environmental impacts associated with both paper 
manufacture (including the demands on our forest res ources) 
and paper recycling.
REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE
In 2019, Synchrony launched a major initiative to increase 
digital usage and decrease paper use. Volumes of mark eting 
direct mail pieces have decreased from a high in 2018 of 168.5 
million pieces to 130.2 million pieces in 2019 and 94 million 
pieces in 2020.
In addition, the elimination of unnecessary envelopes  from 
our cardholders’ statement packages continues to have a 
positive environmental impact. This program has elim inated 
more than 400 million envelopes from statement packag es, 
reducing over 6 million pounds of paper waste, saving over 
22,000 trees, 5,388,000 gallons of water, and offsetting over 
8,705,000 pounds of GHG emissions. 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT  / 63Our digital channels also make it easy for our cardholders t o receive statements and make payments electronically. We cont inue to 
encourage adoption of this environmentally friendly  option through regular communication with our custo mers. By the end of 2020, 
over 44% of our customers received paperless statements, as compared to just over 30% at the end of 2017, which equates to 1 09 
million fewer paper statements being printed and mailed in 2 020 as compared to 2017. In addition, 61% of all applications were 
done digitally in 2020, an increase of 13% from 2019, and appr oximately 65% of our payments were made digitally. 
Recycling paper is an important part of Synchrony’s sustaina bility program. When organizations consider the benefits of p aper 
shredding, they often do so in relation to security and protec tion of sensitive information; however, paper shredding als o offers 
meaningful environmental benefits. In addition to the 100% r ecycled wood particleboard containers installed at our faci lities, our 
shredding vendor utilizes systems that allow shredded material to be recy cled and reused in useful consumer goods such as paper, 
tissues, paper towels and paper plates.

One of the operational impacts organizations can perform is 
to reduce waste and incorporate necessary controls. Upward s 
of 375 million ink cartridges a year or more than one million 
cartridges per day end up in landfills worldwide. A good 
amount of this waste is completely unnecessary. Printer ink 
cartridges are built to be easily reused and taking a couple 
extra steps can help minimize waste, shrink your carbon 
footprint, and help boost your bottom line. To reduce the 
impact of the cartridges thrown away every year, Synchrony 
committed to and achieved a 100% printer toner recycling 
level. In 2020, we recycled 1,193 printer drums, saving 
approximately 1,200 gallons of oil. 
Electronic Hazardous Waste Reductions
Synchrony has partnered with an electronics recycli ng vendor 
to implement a responsible wireless reuse and recyc ling 
program within our organization. Our ongoing environmental 
stewardship to reduce e-waste not only saves energy and GHG 
emissions, but also keeps extremely harmful toxins such as 
lead, zinc, mercury and flame retardants from polluting our 
landfills and drinking water. 
Suppliers That Enhance our  
Sustainability Excellence

(Filta). Filta’s “green” services help preserve the environ ment by 
converting waste cooking oil into biodiesel, reduci ng energy 
consumption and food waste. Active fryer management  also 
improves employee safety, reduces costs and increas es 
sustainability. Synchrony chooses the eco-friendly and safer 
alternative, the green edge. 
Active fryer management systems provide a unique wa y to 
make commercial kitchens safer, more efficient and 
environmentally sustainable by micro-filtering existing cooking  
oil, providing bin-free waste oil collection, deep cleaning fryers 
and recycling waste oil into biodiesel fuel. Since 2019, based 
on data from Filta, recycling this oil has saved over 16,700 
pounds of waste oil through biodiesel recycling and  decreased 
oil usage, reducing GHG emissions by 54,900 pounds, 
equivalent to planting 2,700 trees.
One of Synchrony’s significant data center providers builds 
data centers to be compatible with a sustainable fu ture, taking 
into account the growth of cloud computing, increas ing water 
scarcity in much of the world, and the greening of the electrical 
grid. This provider’s data centers are designed with zero wat er 
consumption cooling, unlike data centers that use v arious 
water-consuming cooling methods. This means no wate r 
towers, no evaporative cooling, and very low water use. In 
addition, this provider’s data center incorporates many energy 
and cost-saving features, such as high-efficiency 
uninterruptible power supplies and power distributi on units.2020 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT  / 65Table 1. Global Synchrony Environmental and Sustainability Key Metrics
